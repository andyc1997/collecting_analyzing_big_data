The dissertation is the main focus of this year and so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it. we were given a large list of potential options accommodating many interests and preferred project styles. My supervisor has been extremely helpful and motivating. Even outwith the general dissertation discussions, he has given me an insight into postgraduate options which I am now trying to persue.

I have always loved the city and all seemed perfect on paper, so didn’t think twice about going. However, having now left before the end and largely wasted a few years I seriously wish I had.\nI was straight A’s at A level but never really felt at all like my feet were on the ground here academically, and rarely felt engaged or stimulated by my course. Many people do well here and obviously much of this falls on me, but I definitely feel I could have done much better elsewhere. Likewise, the university administration is cold, unhelpful and impersonal, at times inept. Cant ever remember feeling like I was being supported, and if you want any assistance you have to actively hound down the staff. The only real ‘contact’ you have with the uni is through your tutor, who (while I’m sure excellent as an academic) just wasn’t qualified to give any useful guidance, just repeating generic advice you could find in the prospectus, and the uni clearly cares way more about its reputation than its students.\nThen there is the culture of the campus, which i found to be this weird mix of ‘rah’ rich kids and Student Union PC culture you more associate with american uni’s, which i found impossible to navigate. It’s a very big uni and different people will have different experiences, but I remember feeling very isolated and frustrated a lot of the time here, as well as unhappy. Dont want to necessarily recommend against going because some people have a fantastic experience and I definitely had some bad luck in my time here with regards to the people I found myself in, but I would suggest taking the bad reviews seriously.'}",non_app,"{'How does your uni make efforts to increase your employability (careers department, work placements, transferable skills)?': 'Never Used'}",rat2,{'How many contact hours per week do you have?': '12'},rat4,"{""How good are your university's facilities?"": 'generally very good'}",rat1,"{'How good is the support offered by the uni?

Student Reviewer,15 Jun 17,Philosophy MA (Hons),rat1,"{'Tell us about your overall university experience so far.': 'I\'m going to graduate next month and, if I\'m being honest, I really regret coming to Edinburgh. I\'ve met some really great friends and been taught by some incredibly clever and inspiring lecturers but, on balance, these people are in the minority. I\'m a Scottish student, so I\'m lucky enough to not pay tuition fees, but I\'ve still gained £20,000 worth of living cost debt and spent 4 years of my life fighting the inept university administration at every turn.\nThe vague marking schemes and inability to appeal grades on the basis of ""academic difference of opinion"" makes it very difficult to succeed here. The lack of support for mentally ill and disabled students is a further obstacle which the university repeatedly refuses to address. Sexism is pretty rampant in many subjects, with only 4 female lecturers in my whole degree department, and many courses having a reading list without a single female author. \nDuring my time, I\'ve seen my fellow students act in fairly disgusting ways, and the University administration has either ignored it because they didn\'t care, or because a lot of these students were rich. I\'ve heard students talk in tutorials about killing disabled children, enslaving the poor, and remain unchallenged by lecturers under the pretence of these classes being an ""open environment for ideas"". I\'ve heard stories from my friends about racially ignorant comments in their classes being overlooked, and have witnessed similar comments in my own classes.\nHonestly, if you\'ve gotten into any other universities that you\'ve applied for, I\'d just go there instead. This should be your last resort.'}",rat1,"{'How does your uni make efforts to increase your employability (careers department, work placements, transferable skills)?': ""I get near constant emails from the careers department, but they're mostly for jobs in finance, management, or other generic areas not linked to my degree. The summer schools, go abroad courses, and unpaid internships are only really viable choices if you're rich enough to not have to work in the summer to pay rent.""}",rat3,"{'What do you like most and least about the way your course(s) are taught?': ""It's very inconsistent, but some of my lecturers are really passionate about their subject and genuinely take an interest in your learning. Some of my classes are pretty overcrowded, so 1-on-1 time is pretty limited, but I think some of my lecturers would spend extra time with us if they had the time.""}",rat3,"{""How good are your university's facilities?"": 'Pretty good. The buildings are kept quite well, though the construction work at McEwan Hall ran over its deadline by an entire year.'}",rat1,"{'How good is the support offered by the uni? Think both academic (tutors/feedback) and personal (counselling, etc).': 'Humanities courses are, in general, marked very inconsistently. My marks have depended on the personal opinions of lecturers a lot, and I\'ve found that the best way to get good marks is just, through trial-and-error, to find a lecturer who likes your writing style. The essay and midterm feedback is minimal to say the least. In my second year, I got an essay handed back to me and the marker had just highlighted an entire paragraph and written ""No"" next to it. This was one of 3 total comments on a 1500 word essay that I had spent 4 days writing. From talking to friends in my courses, they\'ve had similar experiences.\nPersonal support is pretty awful too. My friends with mental health issues (such as anxiety and depression) have had little to no support. There\'s a 10 week minimum wait for counselling from the University Student Services. I have a mild learning disability and my requests for altered assessment methods in some courses were ignored.'}",,,rat1,"{""What do you think of your Students' Union in terms of student representation and facilities?"": ""The union is pretty badly organised in my opinion. Every year, the union runs elections for various positions, but none of these positions actually come with the power to change anything because they don't have a separate or ringfenced budget. The societies are organised by the SU a lot, but the political ones (e.g. political party societies, action for Palestine, feminist society) have messy elections where you can easily get away with voting as an unregistered member or voting twice. There's also been issues during my time at University with misogynistic fraternities who would make semi-serious plans about raping female students.""}",rat2,"{'What do you think about the safety, condition, location and cost of your accommodation?': 'My flatmates and I have found bugs in the carpet since we first started living here and the landlords have just told us to ""clean more"" even though we are a very clean flat.

The large number of students you would think would make it easy to make friends but it is the complete polar opposite, if you made it there off of your own back by obtaining good grades rather than Mummy and Daddy paying for you to be there you are the outsider and made aware of this constantly. It is full of public school students and foreign students meaning Scottish students feel like they are on an exchange. The standard of teaching is extremel poor and it is as if lecturers get in and out of the lecture as quickly as possible even if this means missing out part of the course that they have not been able to cover in the designated time period. Feedback is nonexistant and very little help or guidance is provided. In the four years i spent at this university i felt that instead of improving i was taking steps backwards. Not only this but the whole environment and feel of the university is distant from the City in which it inhabits so if you are drawn to the neauty of Edinburgh, the uinversity could not be more distant from this. In my four years it never made me realise who i was as a person, rather it destroyed me as a person, causing me depression which was then even more poorly helped by the university as the councilling sesions on offer were in the middle of the library meaning there was no confidentiality and a maximum of 6 sessions was allowed with no more after.'}",rat3,,rat1,,rat1,,rat1,,,,rat3,,rat3,,rat4,,rat1,

There is so much to do here that you'll feel you won't have enough time to get through it all.\nHowever, I didn't enjoy my course because it lacked what I came for which was Maths.

This meant that I was not learning my course, Maths like I wanted to. The lectures themselves: in first year, lectures include clickers which allows students to communicate to one another when a question appears. The downside is that it takes up a lot of time hence, the depth of content isn't covered like it should be and I felt I wasn't learning as much as could do. \nThe course at Edinburgh is the one reason why I wouldn't continue at this university hence the bad rating. Another reason is that many of the students didn't choose maths as their main course thus it was hard to meet people on my course with a general interest for it. \nIf you can pick a subject that you do like here then you'll find you'll enjoy the rest of the university easily.""}",rat5,"{""How good are your university's facilities?"": ""Library is fantastic.

Double bed and massive kitchen is a big bonus for self catered. The only issue was that many of the people here were not from Edinburgh University hence it was difficult to mix in with my university.

Student Reviewer,28 Jan 14,Environment and Development MSc,rat4,"{'Tell us about your overall university experience so far.': ""To me, Edinburgh Uni is a classic university that is big, traditional and very diverse. You could find any kind of people and research there, simply because of its size.\nThe size means that many administrative processes are very slow and inefficient, but not as bad as to seriously affect your study experience. For example, they switched only recently to a new e-mail provider to replace the previous outdated e-mail provider (a change that had been done at my previous university, a small campus university, many years before). Generally, IT services are not very good. For example, staff and PhD student pages are seriously outdated and the university even recommends PhD students to create homepages on external blogging sites because the university is unable to provide its own platform.\nThe courses are generally of good quality, but not outstanding. At Edinburgh Uni, lecturers are completely normal people who do solid work. Most of them are very much under pressure to produce research output to maintain the high position in rankings which sometimes affects quality of teaching. \nStudent accommodation at Edinburgh Uni is basically a scam. Rooms are much more expensive than on the private market and are mostly taken by rich (Chinese) students from overseas. I think this is the weakest point of the university. There is a lot of networking potential lost in making student accommodation accessible only to the rich.\nThe other weak point of the university are the high tuition fees, especially for overseas students. Basically, you only get either very rich people or people with scholarships.\nOverall, it's the best university in Scotland and one of the best in the UK. Very well respected, but you won't appear overqualified (as might be a problem e.g. with an Oxbridge degree).""}",rat4,,rat4,,rat5,,,,,,rat4,,rat2,,rat5,,rat4,
Student Reviewer,07 Dec 13,Biological Sciences BSc (Hons),rat5,"{'Tell us about your overall university experience so far.': ""First off, Edinburgh is a fantastic place to live and study in. This University will open many doors for you in the future, particularly if you're studying science/medicine etc (I'm studying BSc Biological Sciences (Hons)). If you're also aspiring to do biology here, the course in the first semester isn't especially great but only because its very general as they're trying to show you all aspects of biology in order for you to accurately pick your honours with regards to your interests. The lecturer's/practical leaders are in general very good however it is a totally different way of learning from school so be prepared. There were a couple of particularly bad lecturer's but they change a lot so you're not going to have a bad one for long. The lecturer's who covered the difficult parts of the course were all fantastic. The accommodation however is DISGUSTING and is the only thing I'm not enjoying so far about being here. I stay in self-catered South Clerk Street and it really is horrible (mice, flies, constantly have no hot water, smell of dampness, bad kitchen appliances, bad furnishings in rooms, the list goes on...). However this is the most cheap accommodation and I have been in the nicer self-catered flats which seem very nice to live in and people who live there enjoy it so my advice is to steer clear of the University cheap self-catered flats. One huge good point though is that you meet so many really lovely people staying in halls, so I would recommend it, just not South Clerk Street! Pollock I have never been to however I've heard the food isn't all that great so it's a waste of money to go catered. Overall, I would recommend Edinburgh as it is the highest ranked Uni in Scotland(just now) and you will go places with a degree from here. ""}",rat5,,rat4,,rat4,,,,,,rat4,,rat1,,rat5,,rat4,
