While covid has limited the social side of things it has given me the time to adjust to work. This term the social side has come back and I feel well equipped to balance everything. My tutors have been really good at supporting me and my tute group through this tricky year. They've all been very understanding and accomodating to my mental health needs. Although my tutors have clearly done their best, online learning hasn't been as good as in-person.

rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,ratY,,,,,Samuel,13 Apr 21,Music DPhil," Considering the significant barriers to socialising and general life at University, I think the experience I have had this academic year has been really quite good. The university has, on the whole, managed the situation quite well - but my college (Queen’s) has adopted a particularly good stance which has enabled adherence to the government guidelines, whilst allowing the junior members to enjoy the experience as much as possible. The contact I have with my supervisor is very good, and other members of academic staff are usually very receptive and responsive to emails The facilities, both in terms of outfitting and breadth of choice, are second to none. Support is good, but the waiting lists/bureaucracy is often quite long, so it can be difficult to get immediate support Yes"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,ratY,,,,,Eugene,12 Apr 21,Applied Theology MTh," The college and university have tried their best to make sure that the quality of education wasn't diminished this year because of COVID-19. This year being my dissertation year, with more emphasis on self-study and research instead of lots of contact hours with tutors, made it so that I didn't feel the impact as much as I might have in a different course. My supervisors this year have been excellent, so even though I didn't have a lot of contact hours, each tutorial session I had with them allowed me to hone my research further and further. If you know what you want out of the course and what area you want to go into going forward, this is a really great course. The freedom in the range of topics you can pick for your papers really allows you to tailor the course to your specific needs. That being said, if you don't know, it might be better to choose a course with a more specific scope. I knew what I wanted to study and my future goals going into the course, and so I got a lot out of exploring theology from the lens of that area, but for someone with a less clear vision it may be harder to do that. Lectures can be hit or miss depending on if they are relevant to what you are studying, but it's worth it to listen to see if there are any interesting ideas you can write about in your paper. The most important people are the supervisors for your papers. If you get really good supervisors, you'll be challenged and stretched to go beyond your own assumptions and views about theology in order to craft a really good paper. Yes"

The facilities vary quite a lot from college to college; my colleges gym etc are a bit basic but other colleges have fantastic facilities. Everyone has access to really good libraries etc. Generally my academic feedback has been thorough and helpful. Though the variable nature of the way teaching is organised means that some people have bad experiences. My college offers a lot of welfare support. Many of the activities carried out by the SU elsewhere are undertaken at college level so I haven't really engaged with the SU at all/drawn on its resources. My college JCR is good though. In first year I lived in Wolfson Building in St hildas college. It was adequate but basic - which is typical of first year accom in Oxford. I love Oxford. For me, it is the perfect size for a uni city: there is a lot going on, but simultaneously a palpable uni community. Oxford is a beautiful place to live.

rat1,rat2,rat1,rat5,rat2,,rat3,rat2,rat2,rat2,Student Reviewer,06 Nov 16,Oriental Studies MSt," Overall university experience was frankly dreadful, I used to lock myself in my room and just cry on the floor at least once a week because I felt so overwhelmed with the work. The essays I slaved over often weren't handed back to me on time in order to look at the feedback before writing another one. It was dire. See other sections for my further comments. Careers department only geared up for law, finance and the like. No knowledge of creative areas. NOTHING. STAY AWAY. At this point I would like to point out that I studied Oriental Studies Japanese at Oxford (BA) but WhatUni doesn't list this course so I have to leave a review for the MSt (sorry). 
Some lecturers were fine, but unfortunately the organisation of the Oriental Institute was so terrible that I felt it greatly disadvantaged the students on the course. Such as:
- Course options listed in the prospectus were suddenly made unavailable in the term before specialisation, meaning that students who had wanted to study, for example, Japanese theatre or sociology, now had to choose between linguistics, literature or politics. Although the lecturers had sufficient time to warn us of this, they refused to respond to our requests, and in fact shouted at the students who enquired above the departmental lecturers, as though it wasn't a reasonable request to want to know which options would be available!
- In the second year, students were required to attend daily lectures at the Chinese institute, which were provided for the benefit of Sinologist students. The course content was not relevant to the Japanese exam contents. One wonders why the students were thus required to attend.
- Course was changed for the lower years meaning the new students had to try to learn modern and classical Japanese in the same year, which of course was impossible. Imagine trying to teach Shakespeare to a Japanese high schooler learning to say 'hello' - you just wouldn't do it. But the Oxford Oriental Institute would!
- Grades for the annual exams were publicly circulated by the lecturers amongst the students. 
- No pastoral support during the year abroad. Not even to help students find a placement before they left. No guidebook. No advice as to our student status during that year, which led to some students' final year funding being cancelled. 
- Not all the material was covered before the final exams. Lecturers not bothered, although 
- Contents of the final exams changed three weeks prior to final exams.
- Final exam format being significantly different to what we had been told (ie 'In this exam you will not be required to read' and then having a reading section). 
- As far as the famous Oxford tutorial system of one-on-ones with your lecturers, this did not exist for the Oriental Studies Japanese course. Our tutorials in final year were with a group of five students and one lecturer. That is a seminar, not an Oxford tutorial.
- No official 'head of course' or person who would respond to our enquiries, doubts or concerns. 
All in all, I could not have had a more disappointing experience at Oxford. I hear the Chinese Institute is much more organised, so perhaps that course would be worth considering in place of this one. I could recommend the Japanese course to wealthy students with nerves of steel, who require four hours sleep a night and no social life, who enjoy linguistics, history and classical Japanese. If you are remotely interested in sociology or any humanities aspect, pick any other course. Honestly at the end I was broken and totally disillusioned with Oxford. 0/10. Excellent librairies Tutors can be utterly awful and the 'moral tutors' who are responsible for your welfare appear to have no training in this area or even a smidgen of common sense ('Depression? But you look very well.') 
The counselling service was much better, highly recommended. Good, with a visible presence Expensive Alright if you don't mind the lack of activities or social diversity Not impressed with the ball system, which effectively acts as a social filter (some ball tickets 200 quid a pop, good luck with trying to attend your college party if you're from a low-income background)."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat1,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Contemporary India MSc, The students union is too expensive and is elitist. I like the quality of delivery in the classes and find the accommdation very good indeed. CIty life is good - love going to cafes and such things.

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat2,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Law, I havent mad any use of the support services so far. I find the topics covered in the classes interesting. The Accomodation is expensive and bad quality. The city is small and sleepy - i would prefer a little livelier.

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat2,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Medicine, Good range of clubs and societies - people watching in cafes is my favourite thing to do in my spare time. Would recomnend for sure.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Biochemistry (Molecular and Cellular) MBiochem, Students union- what students union?!?!?!? Need a students union then I'll comment on it.
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat4,,rat1,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Philosophy and Theology BA (Hons), Really not impressed with the accomodation. Not impressed with the studnets union or even the course and lecturers.

rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History, Courses and lectures are good because of their flexability. Accomdation is cheaper than private rental. Libraries are really good. I love my debating society very much.
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Human Sciences BA (Hons), Work is very intense but the career options are great so it is all worth it. Students union is non existant - needs radically improving if you want to get the satisfaction up in this area.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat1,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Physics," Fulfilling, full of opportunity and privelidge. Dissertation opportunity has expert supervision. Accomodation is well maintained and modern. Good location good facilities. College sport access schemes are good."

rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History, I am quite happy here. Uni facilities are not so amazing I would have a lot of suggestions if you'd like my oppionoin. Course and lecturers are good though - I really appreciate the goodness of the whole offer.

rat5,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History, Loved every minute. Oxford is a lot more fun that what people think. The lectures are at 12pm so you can lie in!
rat4,rat5,rat1,rat5,rat1,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Law, A mix of different people - some good and some bad. Students union is rubbish though needs lots of improvement.

rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,"Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA (Hons)", Very very very good! Support services are great and so is city life. clubs and societies are awesome.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,European Politics and Society," Overall I love it. We have great professors, there are a wide variety of clubs and societies and I feel set up well for future job prospects. Students Union could be better."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Human Sciences BA (Hons), I love it here! I feel ther ability to learn as much as I want and learn in depth too.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Physics, Excellent if extremely tiring! I believe finding a job will be easy due to the University's prestige.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat1,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Archaeology and Anthropology BA (Hons), Fantastic accommodation very good uni facilities would like different ethnicity clubs and societies and a better student union.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Biology, Everything is in walking distance and is very reputable. I like my course and my lecturers and we have fantastic support services at the University.
rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Economics and Management BA (Hons), Good except that there are too many posh people. Good value accomodation in comparason to private landlords but still expensive.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat2,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History, Pretty much everything you need is provided somewhere in the uni. Great job prospects too so am happy.
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Geography and Environment, Accomodation is very easy for foreign students and is very reliable. City life is good for dinner and drinks.
rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Chemistry," Lectures are very interesting, I get to do my own reserach and go abroard to do a project. Everything applies to the real world."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat2,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Geography BA (Hons), I've met some great people and had the opportunity to do many things. The material I cover is very mind-body interaction etc. v interesting.
rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Psycholoy and Philosophy, Job prospects here are outstanding. Good options with clubs and societies.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,PPE," It's really amazing and I am lucky to be here. Facilities are great, libraries are fantastic and I would say the gym is outdated though."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Law BA (Hons)," The atmosphere of intellect and prestige is largely unparallled, and that is a great advantage from which Oxford benefits. You are being taught and lectured by the people writing the textbook. However, it can get too stressful at times, and the problem with this is that being stressed to some degree is the norm, so you fee as if it takes a really severe case of stress (e.g. resulting in mental health issues) before it is 'legitimate' to speak up, even though it should not be as such."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Archaeology and Anthropology BA (Hons)," The university overall is outstanding. The calibre of professors is absolutely world class, and the research being done is often cutting edge. The quality of teaching varies between tutors - some, whilst being incredible academics, are less proficient than others at teaching, and due to the tutorial system, a lot of what you learn will be from your tutor."
rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat2,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Chemistry MChem (Hons)," Overall I feel Oxford Uni is the perfect place to get a degree which at the end of the day is what you're here to do. Work comes first, even before yourself and personal welfare which is something I disagree with and think they need to improve on but overall a great place if you're willing to work hard."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Chemistry MChem (Hons)," Incredible University which I am proud to be a part of. Being part of a college really helps to make it a personal experience but you still feel like part of the whole University. Some absolutely brilliant lecturers but also a minority who are boring or just plain bad.
 Much better than I expected"
rat1,rat2,rat1,rat4,,,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,05 Sep 14,Law BA (Hons)," it very good, me very like had very funs.. got my master i catch all the pokemons when i go to oxfords"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat2,,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,14 May 14,Civil Law BCL," Good for academics and job prospects. Good mix of people. Only about 60% of the media stereotypes are true (i.e. about poshness and racism ect)
Excellent tutorials and courses. My one major complaint is the facilities. I have studies at 3 universities now (Exeter and Lancaster) . Both had 24hr libraries and lots of computers ect. Oxford has DIRE facilities. Everything is constantly shut (the libraries all shut at like 6 even before exams, and during the holidays they often close altogether). We have 4 PCs to 400 students in my college. I cant stress how disruptive and annoying the libraries always being closed is.
That is my only one main complaint. Everything else is very good. Yeah its very snooty and posh but everyone gets over the novelty after a while and you gradually filter out those people. "
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," My uni is great - I enjoy being surrounded by people with equal passion for the subject I study. The facilities are really good and I love the town I am living in, there are always things to do. Work is stressful, but worth the future job prospects. Nightlife is good too, and I enjoy the fact that I can go home whenever I want if I am missing family and friends. I hve finally adapted to university life and am fully enjoying and using my time here!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," University is a place where they work incredibly hard, but getting things done is rather fulfilling. Around work and singing, I try to go out as much as possible, meeting people in other colleges and spending time with my core group of friends. It is great fun and a very established university that I am proud to be involved with."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I really enjoy being in Oxford. There is always so much to do, with there being a club and society for everything. Medicine also allows you to get to know people in different colleges. College life is every integrated, with a good social life but also a good support network to help you with all you work."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Oxford has something of a reputation for its intensity, and hasn't failed to disappoint. The short, concentrated terms are compensated for by ample holiday time for personal study, but exams every term keep you on the ball. The labs are beneficial, if a little long, and having 3 hours of tutorials per week has had a massive impact on my understanding. Somehow I still find time to socialise, although less than at Christ's Hospital."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Work hard, play hard. I'm in chapel choir so I have to be super organised with time and work. There's good emotional and financial support for the stressful times, of which there are many. Great transport links and future prospects, and my own college bar 2mins walk away #winning #oxford"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Everything is fantastic, both socially and academically. The university resources, teaching, and the course are all obviously at the top of their area internationally so I could ask for no better. Socially, Oxford is a brilliant city for students, the nightlife is great and the city in general has so much to do all the time."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,13 Mar 14,Mathematics BA (Hons), Best university ever
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,13 Mar 14,Engineering MEng (Hons), Lives up to all the expectations in so many ways. Engineering course is a bit 'tick-box' and uninspiring but I think that's an exception. So many incredible opportunities in Oxford. Hard work though - very intense.
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,13 Mar 14,Mathematics and Philosophy BA (Hons)," Great place to get to know different types of intelligent people, be challenged by the intensity of the courses here. Job prospects are worse than what one would on average expect when arriving here - important to start looking for a job during the early years at University."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,12 Feb 14,Biomedical Sciences BA (Hons), excellent uni a lot of work 
rat2,rat3,rat4,rat2,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,13 Dec 13,US History MSt," The reason I scored 'City Life' quite low was because I grew up in Oxford so it's nothing new to me.
The libraries at Oxford are good but are far too spread out over the city. I would prefer everything to be in one place.
I would only recommend my University to prospective students based on some areas, not all. "
