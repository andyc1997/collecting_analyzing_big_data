I lived in halls which meant I was able to meet some people and be involved in the Edinburgh community. I think the university’s ability to teach online also increased throughout the year. In semester 1 it was quite disappointing and there were a lot of problems across all 3 of my courses, but by semester 2 this has massively improved and I felt I was benefiting from good quality teaching 3 I didn’t have much access to them, but the library spaces were all great. They adapted well to COVID and turned a lot of classroom buildings into extra library space which could all be booked through an app I was very lucky to have a great personal tutor/academic advisor who was super helpful. I worked with the student counselling service in semester one and they were not great, the counsellor made me feel uncomfortable and the wait times were bad.

Should a student be relatively self motivated - their was nothing that UoE or ECA provided that the student could not have done themselves (on the fine art course). Art History was much better, with pre-recorded lectures and tutorials being easily accessible and effective as learning tools. A mixed experience.

Clinicians really want to teach and are very kind.

rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,ratN,,,,,Solomon,25 May 21,Politics MA (Hons)," The University has failed to adequately adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were major issues with accessibility to teaching due to poor broadband in halls and with isolation policies (leading to the Sports Union stepping in to deliver meals). Whilst these issues were mostly resolved in Semester 2, we were promised a hybrid learning model, which has still failed to materialise. I would not have moved to Edinburgh if I had known the university would provide the year it has. 4 All University of Edinburgh facilities (social and academic) are clean and easily accessible and are of good quality. Counselling is easily accessible via the university, whilst it can be difficult to find some support groups (such as LGBT+ ones) they are there. Accommodation sites have some of their own support structures, as do schools and colleges and the university itself. No"
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,ratY,,,,,Emma,11 May 21,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Love this uni, it’s beautiful with caring staff and constant support. Only thing that would be better is if the course was more interactive so students living at home can make more friends in their course. There are career opportunity days you can go to and you learn about so many areas of life that your interests expand and consequently as do your career ideas 10 Very beautiful buildings which are well looked after. Loads of places you can study at and the library is very big and relaxing. Amazing student support, there’s nightlines if you’re feeling down and personal tutors are understanding and helpful. Yes"
rat2,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,ratN,,,,,Anais,06 May 21,Japanese MA (Hons)," I think every university experience this year has unfortunately been poor in comparison to previous years. Online classes have been isolating and my metal health has been affected as a result. I also have much less contact hours a week, and I am extremely concerned about the cancellation of my year aboard and the ramification it will have on my language level when I graduate. I have not really received any guidance but there are open days and career councillors if needed 10 The university of Edinburgh has very accessible libraries, gyms, social areas and cafes which are all central to campus The university of Edinburgh offers free counselling to those who need it, they diagnose disabilities such as ASD for free and offer a lot of support and adjustments to accommodate them No"

It depends on which modules you take There are jobs fairs and online opportunities 0 The library is good and is still open You can contact your tutor for help but I've heard bad things about the councilling service No

rat2,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat2,ratN,,,,,Abby,11 Apr 21,Doctor of Veterinary Medicine DVetMed," Clinicians and people lecturers are very helpful and supportive. They clearly care about us students. Upper management does not seem to care about student feelings or experience. When talking to lower years they only tell them the positive feedback and ignore the negative, showing they don’t care and/or listen. Our year is expected to accept anything that is done (or not done) and get on with it. There is no explanations given when deadlines aren’t met on the part of the university and little consideration seems to be given for us. A real shame, given how wonderful the teaching staff are. 16 No"

No"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,ratN,,,,,Rebecca,07 Apr 21,Biomedical Sciences (Life Sciences) MScR, This year has been very different due to Covid (as can be expected) but this definitely had an impact on how much I enjoyed the course. Due to working remotely the only real contact we had was with our project supervisor and this was limited. I think if this was any other year in which we were allowed access to labs then it would be a very different story and an enjoyable course 3 No

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,ratY,,,,,Ruairidh,02 Apr 21,Neuroscience BSc (Hons), Overall experience this year had been pretty good considering we have been left with only online lectures and seminars could have been better if there was more interaction between the lecturers and the students 120 Yes
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,ratY,,,,,Celine,01 Apr 21,Medical Sciences BSc (Hons)," Overall I am very happy with my experience here. So much so that i want to come back to do a Masters by Research next year. The staff have been really supportive and have tried their best throughout the pandemic. We only had very little contact hours since the pandemic which was a downside, but i think staff wanted to make sure everyone had equal access to the content, no matter what country or timezone they were in. The dissertation is the main focus of this year and so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it. we were given a large list of potential options accommodating many interests and preferred project styles. My supervisor has been extremely helpful and motivating. Even outwith the general dissertation discussions, he has given me an insight into postgraduate options which I am now trying to persue. I have managed to keep in touch with a lot of friends even throughout the pandemic. The university societies have tried to encourage this by arranging online social such as breakout rooms and online quizzes to prevent people from feeling alone during these challenging times. Careers service is really helpful. Insights week was very good to get an idea of graduate options 3 Clean, spacious, plenty options to go to I haven’t used these services and have heard both good and bad things about them Yes"
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,ratN,,,,,Rebecca,01 Apr 21,Biomedical Sciences (Life Sciences) MScR," This year has been a strange year due to the pandemic which has limited the amount of experience we were able to gain from the first 6 months of the degree. The next 6 months are looking brighter and I truly believe that if I had done this course a year later a lot would have changed. The university is great, the location is lovely, the people are friendly and the lecturers are super helpful. 2 No"

rat1,rat4,rat2,rat1,rat1,,rat1,rat3,rat5,non_app,Alex,16 Feb 21,Law (Graduate Entry) LLB," I have met some amazing people here. However, that is probably my only positive outcome. The University itself I could not recommend on any front. If you can choose to go somewhere else I would suggest you do. The careers service are pretty good at trying to create opportunities through seminars and one-on-one meetings. 3 The library is murder trying to get a seat, and lecture theatres are camped and out dated. The support is shocking and any complaints raised are batted away if they are even responded to at all. If you are looking for a hands off University this is the perfect one. However, as soon as you have a query or a worry about anything from academic marks to mental health, the University does not want to know you. Same as the University itself, the SU purports to help but no change is ever actually brought about. The flats in Edinburgh are beautiful, but the hunt for one is difficult as landlords and letting agents with pit students against each other to raise prices. The price of rent has gone up by over £250 a month in my time here. Everything is close by no matter where you live. The public transport around the city is really great also."
rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,,rat1,rat4,rat4,rat4,M,21 Sep 20,Animation BA (Hons)," I am ashamed of my time there. I regret choosing the university and I will be paying off the debt for most of my life despite not being given anything that was advertised upon application. they didn't 1 our studio didn't have heat and was freezing cold during the winter. Most facilities were still in storage after a studio move at the start of my time there. There was never enough computers, spaces, equipment for all students and it led to many students not being able to follow the paths they wished to take very poor. It was very rare to find the tutors on campus and after spending most of the first year making attempts to ask for lessons and to see tutors in order to be taught, we eventually all gave up as complaints were never seen through by the university bad Prices in Edinburgh can be very high. yes Didn't take part"
rat2,rat2,rat5,rat2,rat4,,non_app,,rat3,rat3,Helene,09 Jun 20,PGDE German (Graduates only) Professional Graduate Diploma," Your job prospects depend severely on your location and willingness to move. I had mentors living in Midlothian who were commuting all the way to West Lothian. They were teaching a subject in high demand but could not find a job within reasonable commuting distance. One of them needed to drive 140 min every day. Additionally, if your subject is quite niche (Modern Foreign Languages, Music, Latin, even Physics), you may be the one person who does not get a placement. I was stuck home twice and missed out on 3 weeks of placements (of 12 in total!) because the university could not organise a placement for me. Additionally, the university does not provide support when bullying in schools takes place. Mentors can be harsh and are not monitored at all. Racism in school is often ignored by the mentors. Placements are planned by the university, but some subjects (especially mine) were struggling to find placements. The potential issues and prospects for future employment were not communicated during the initial interview. Please do your research before you accept a place. The market for teachers is not as bright as the university makes it out to be. Be prepared to commute up to 180 min per day and accept that you may have to move once your studies are finished. 12 Very outdated, buildings from the 70s. The university offers a lot of support and is considerate. However, I had one issue where I felt I was not heard at all and I wish my situation had been dealt with differently. Moray House is off-campus and it takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to the main campus of the University of Edinburgh. There is one big coffee shop right around the corner, but if you are looking for restaurants, you have to walk."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,,rat5,rat4,Yalan,19 Feb 20,," the academic environment is the best! use the library resources wisely and you'll gain a lot! besides studies, do join some student societies which would be great fun! personally i highly recommend harry potter society and theatre/drama societies. outside uni, explore the city, because you can go to all tourist attractions on foot! it is a historical city with traditional architecture, but you could also enjoy modern theatrical arts especially in summer holiday (Edinburgh international festival and fringe festival). yes, it's in city centre, and all the accommodations are within 15 mins walking distance."

Academically incredibly variable, mostly based on which professor you have - some make you want to learn about a subject you didn't think you cared about, some make you resent a subject you thought you were passionate about Not all too applicable to my degree 6 Mostly excellent. Often lacking but not awful Relatively good Yes Strong"

The uni employs students in EUSA jobs 20 The facilites such as the gym are very good and well stocked Counselling is excellent how ever feed back needs improvement The students that represent for each class are well known as well as for the school Yes it’s right next to shops and clubs as well as 20 mins from Main Street There are many different societies
rat1,rat3,rat2,rat2,rat1,,rat1,,rat3,rat4,H,14 Mar 19,International Relations MA (Hons)," The city is nice (though it is true that it is expensive)
The uni..I do not suggest you to come here. 
If you want to do nothing for the first two years, and you are a feminist, this is your place. I dont know what efforts they make, but since I'm a foreigner making plans to work in my country, it is no use 4 Poor. Facilities itself arent a problem. The problem is that there isnt enough of it - computers, seats in libraries, study spaces....
This uni just wants money from international students without improving anything It depends
You may end up with tutors who does not provide any guidance or feedback hours and just wants to talk in email.
The worst tutor Ive met was the tutor in South Asia, Economics, Politics and culture. She never spends time making an advice. If you send an outline to her, she just says its fine and give you a bad grade. Do not trust tutors. Your outlines must have problems and no note on outline means you need to chase them for more advice, which they may or may not give.
You can also end up with tutors who really spends time to help you. I hope you do I dont get involved simply because I dont need them Generally good. I like the city as I hate living in large cities I have not joined a society, so I cannot make any comment on it"
rat1,rat3,rat1,rat2,rat1,,non_app,,rat4,non_app,AJ.,28 Jan 19,," Edinburgh is more focused on preserving its dwindling reputation and making money than providing the tools for students to succeed. If you enjoy partying and having no money, Edinburgh is great. Almost everyone i know works full time as well to meet living costs. If you are either over 25 or not from private education you will be ostracised. Also, a note on mature students. The demographic is 17 - 21. If you fall outside of that,good luck. If you want to work in finance then its great. There are employement open days over the semester 12 I haven't used any of the facilities. But there are a lot of them. Horrible. I have only heard from my PT once, during compulsory welcome week meeting. Feedback on essay's are obscure and not helpful. There is a writing center to help you write more academically, but hou book a slot with a specific problem to be addressed. Most queries have a cover answer which your name is pasted on, so there is no genuine connection with anyone. If you think you will need support, Edinburgh is not for you. I don't use it. It seems focused on the wrong things, such as community and well being. Edinburgh is very expensive. What ever you enjoy doing the city can provide. Just make sure you have plenty money."

During the UCU strikes I was in a small minority of people not going to their lectures in support of the strikel. I study art tho. The careers department seems pretty good What does this question mean? The library is good? Personally, I receive adequate support via. disability services but I've heard the counselling is not great, services are stretched I have not engaged much with the SU so I don not have much opinion Uni halls were okay but in Edi accommodation is very expensive <400/month rent not including bills in the private rental market Nice variety of things to do.

rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat1,,rat2,,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 18,Photography BA (Hons)," Not the best uni in the world. If you're really independent maybe ok for you, or you could as well just save couple grants and just go to work instead. Not much at ECA, some work offers forwarded by tutors. Facilities are the best thing about this Uni. Great resources, library and equipment. Next to none.
Same with the counsellor, waited for 4 weeks to meet yet the counsellor referred me to an online help instead of another meeting. 
Academic support ok, really depends who you'll get, because some tutors are really oldschool and don't get your ideas at all. Had 1 good tutor in 3 years there in my last year and it was amazing! But before that 2 years of struggle. no involvement, overpriced, no space for art students to get involved, too posh EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE! The rent is just ridiculous. Otherwise ok, nice nature, sea, etc. Alternative music scene poor. Some nice ones for sure, recommend to join in the first year!"
rat5,non_app,rat2,rat4,rat1,,rat1,,rat5,rat3,Patrick,08 Jun 18,Philosophy MA (Hons)," On applying to Edinburgh I was aware of some of the poor satisfaction ratings, but didn’t think much of them given the reputation of the University. I have always loved the city and all seemed perfect on paper, so didn’t think twice about going. However, having now left before the end and largely wasted a few years I seriously wish I had.
I was straight A’s at A level but never really felt at all like my feet were on the ground here academically, and rarely felt engaged or stimulated by my course. Many people do well here and obviously much of this falls on me, but I definitely feel I could have done much better elsewhere. Likewise, the university administration is cold, unhelpful and impersonal, at times inept. Cant ever remember feeling like I was being supported, and if you want any assistance you have to actively hound down the staff. The only real ‘contact’ you have with the uni is through your tutor, who (while I’m sure excellent as an academic) just wasn’t qualified to give any useful guidance, just repeating generic advice you could find in the prospectus, and the uni clearly cares way more about its reputation than its students.
Then there is the culture of the campus, which i found to be this weird mix of ‘rah’ rich kids and Student Union PC culture you more associate with american uni’s, which i found impossible to navigate. It’s a very big uni and different people will have different experiences, but I remember feeling very isolated and frustrated a lot of the time here, as well as unhappy. Dont want to necessarily recommend against going because some people have a fantastic experience and I definitely had some bad luck in my time here with regards to the people I found myself in, but I would suggest taking the bad reviews seriously. Never Used 12 generally very good My tutor was next to useless, and he was the only contact I had with the university. Simply wasn't qualified to give any useful advice, and normally just directed me to someone else. politically correct nightmare. edinburgh is a great city Some were fine, though I was never bowled away by organisation. Tennis was good if you made one of the three teams (so 20 people in a uni of 20,000) and i narrowly missed out, otherwise poor."
rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,,non_app,,non_app,rat1,Student Reviewer,07 Apr 18,Software Engineering BEng (Hons)," I was a straight A student at school, my average now is 46%. Dreams die here, dont come here, people are rude and horrible and no one cares about your problems. Edinburgh takes independent study to a whole new level, I feel bad for students that have to pay tuition because they really arent getting their moneys worth at all! It doesnt. I have been to one careers talk by google but when it comes to employability (and everything else actually), you're on your own 15 the computer labs are quite nice to look at, however during multiple programing exams my computer has failed and it affected my final result Horrendous, tutors take days to email back, no support for mental health, advice is abismal The union is for posh students, its essentially a big old house full of coffee shops and tories people in edinburgh aren't friendly. I lived in accommodation for three months and ended up moving home. mThe night life is boring, one decent club if you're lucky There are many societies, I dont go to any because I dont have any friends because Edinburgh university makes no effort to cater for students needs socially"
rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat1,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Mar 18,," It has been stressful due to terrible accommodation and unhelpful/ rude management team. Also we had strikes and over a month of missed lectures which coupled with little contact time in semester 2 meant i don't feel I've gained much from semester 2. Semester one was good. Semester 2 pretty bad. The career department offers good advice 4 Great Academic - tutors will make an effort to give feedback and advice whenever needed
Counselling - i don't know It's very helpful, particularly the student advice section. I haven't really gotten involved as i am very busy! The accommodation was unfinished when i got here and construction work resumed for months. We still had to pay in full even though many facilities were and are still missing. Issues ranged from construction workers coming in our flats without warning to noise from 7 am to 5 pm to dust to broken windows not repaired etc. Really bad.

Counselling seriously underfunded Facilities are expensive in comparison with other SU's lots of good representation but feels like they don't make anything happen. Halls were a bit dingy, for how much money we were paying but generally good people.

rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,18 Dec 17,, Placement would be useful
rat1,rat1,rat3,rat3,rat1,,rat1,rat2,rat4,rat2,Student Reviewer,15 Jun 17,Philosophy MA (Hons)," I'm going to graduate next month and, if I'm being honest, I really regret coming to Edinburgh. I've met some really great friends and been taught by some incredibly clever and inspiring lecturers but, on balance, these people are in the minority. I'm a Scottish student, so I'm lucky enough to not pay tuition fees, but I've still gained £20,000 worth of living cost debt and spent 4 years of my life fighting the inept university administration at every turn.
The vague marking schemes and inability to appeal grades on the basis of ""academic difference of opinion"" makes it very difficult to succeed here. The lack of support for mentally ill and disabled students is a further obstacle which the university repeatedly refuses to address. Sexism is pretty rampant in many subjects, with only 4 female lecturers in my whole degree department, and many courses having a reading list without a single female author. 
During my time, I've seen my fellow students act in fairly disgusting ways, and the University administration has either ignored it because they didn't care, or because a lot of these students were rich. I've heard students talk in tutorials about killing disabled children, enslaving the poor, and remain unchallenged by lecturers under the pretence of these classes being an ""open environment for ideas"". I've heard stories from my friends about racially ignorant comments in their classes being overlooked, and have witnessed similar comments in my own classes.
Honestly, if you've gotten into any other universities that you've applied for, I'd just go there instead. This should be your last resort. I get near constant emails from the careers department, but they're mostly for jobs in finance, management, or other generic areas not linked to my degree. The summer schools, go abroad courses, and unpaid internships are only really viable choices if you're rich enough to not have to work in the summer to pay rent. It's very inconsistent, but some of my lecturers are really passionate about their subject and genuinely take an interest in your learning. Some of my classes are pretty overcrowded, so 1-on-1 time is pretty limited, but I think some of my lecturers would spend extra time with us if they had the time. Pretty good. The buildings are kept quite well, though the construction work at McEwan Hall ran over its deadline by an entire year. Humanities courses are, in general, marked very inconsistently. My marks have depended on the personal opinions of lecturers a lot, and I've found that the best way to get good marks is just, through trial-and-error, to find a lecturer who likes your writing style. The essay and midterm feedback is minimal to say the least. In my second year, I got an essay handed back to me and the marker had just highlighted an entire paragraph and written ""No"" next to it. This was one of 3 total comments on a 1500 word essay that I had spent 4 days writing. From talking to friends in my courses, they've had similar experiences.
Personal support is pretty awful too. My friends with mental health issues (such as anxiety and depression) have had little to no support. There's a 10 week minimum wait for counselling from the University Student Services. I have a mild learning disability and my requests for altered assessment methods in some courses were ignored. The union is pretty badly organised in my opinion. Every year, the union runs elections for various positions, but none of these positions actually come with the power to change anything because they don't have a separate or ringfenced budget. The societies are organised by the SU a lot, but the political ones (e.g. political party societies, action for Palestine, feminist society) have messy elections where you can easily get away with voting as an unregistered member or voting twice. There's also been issues during my time at University with misogynistic fraternities who would make semi-serious plans about raping female students. My flatmates and I have found bugs in the carpet since we first started living here and the landlords have just told us to ""clean more"" even though we are a very clean flat. The rent + bills are so high that I have less than £50 left of my student loan per month to live on. If I didn't have a part time job then I don't know how I could afford to live here. Relative to where some of my classmates live, this is a cheaper area. Edinburgh is a beautiful city with a rich culture and heritage. There's a decent selection of clubs, bars, restaurants, and cultural sites such as the museums, galleries, or monuments. This is one of the best things about being a student in Edinburgh. A decent selection, though some of them require memberships to be purchased before you can try them out. As I mentioned while talking about the student union, there's a lot of issues about how the societies are run. If you have a job, it's pretty hard to go to any societies just because they can be quite time-consuming (especially sports societies)."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat2,Student Reviewer,25 Feb 17,Photography BA (Hons)," Overall, I've enjoyed it but have encountered a few difficulties which the uni was very supportive with and ultimately helped sort instantly. I've had a good experience so far and find it a very homely place to live. Always seem to be careers advice emails sent around - I've yet to attend one of these sessions and we have a few careers festivals catered to certain subjects. For example there's a creative careers festival soon where I've signed up for an awful lot of workshops. Lecturers are very passionate about both their work and others. Brilliant facilities and we have a new department opening soon which will open up more opportunities. The best out of the art schools I applied to regarding facilities - especially with the new department opening in late 2017. Overall, in the University the libraries and other facilities are very good. Support is phenomenal; the counselling tends to have a long waiting list but personal support has been very helpful and efficient. Academic support is great but I'd like more 1:1 feedback. Financial support has also been wonderful for me regarding low income bursaries so I can't fault the support system of the uni. I get involved in a few things but would like to do more in an ideal world. However, workload doesn't allow this. Overall, regarding advice and any problems, they've been extremely helpful! I chose to stay in my current halls for 2nd year also - they felt very safe yet fun and in a beautiful part of Edinburgh. However, previously I lived in different university-managed halls around Leith area and had a bad experience so moved after a few months. Very expensive...but overall, it's an expensive city and I knew when I applied so have generally budgeted a lot. There's always stuff going on, especially for the arts and it's quite a lovely place! Expensive!! Ridiculous entry fees for clubs! In comparison to home, the night life isn't great at all but I get involved elsewhere and save for bigger nights at home.
Societies are great and friendly but I don't attend as many as I'd like to."

I feel like te Uni is slightly orientated towards the wealthy, we might have to buy bolly and most students are posh. (Regular emails from career service), I haven't heard much but haven't looked into it yet. One of my courses is super interesting and the lecturers are really amazing, some are really confusing and seem to expect you to have an impossible prior knowledge. Not so great, we don't always fir in the lecture hall and there are never enough books. There are lots of options for if you need help. It is so pretty. Mine is quite far away but it is nice and has a great view. Gorgeous. So many options of what to do. Fairly expensive.

Careers service is fantastic! It really depends on the school though. Geosciences is awful, business school is great for example. My professor They are excellent except study space capacity is too low. Geography facilities are not good - very old. Edinburgh is a research - intensive University, the tutors don't really care, they just want to do their research. Awesome!!! Great foods, atmosphere and student representation is nice! So much fun!

Tons of seminars, fairs and counselling available. The lecturers are personable and seek to be less distant with students, and they are very inclusive. Good, nice cafes around and space to work. Wifi in certain areas gets wonky. I am sure it is great, haven't tested it out. They are quite active and engaged and they seem to care. Lovely historic city that is not too bustling and busy. Some are a waste of time, such as Tea Society."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,02 Dec 16,Applied Sport Science BSc (Hons)," Good. Staff are helpful and I am comfortable asking for help. May be due to my courses small class size. Work placements and outside courses are offered. Staff are really helpful - lecturers and technicians. Dated Lecturers are helpful. - An expensive SU!

As I said before University needs to address Student needs better. Very informed and helpful. Professors who care about their students. The University could do much more to help students and address different learning styles. While my professors have been very helpful, the Uni's administration (especially dealing with disabilities) has been problematic. Very good, Clean, affordable and good staff.

Does very well in this, big careers department and a lot on lab work. My lecturers know their stuff, and 4th year courses are amazing because it is a lot chosen to what the lectures actually research. They are really nice. It is a bit small, but that is to be expected on a city campus. It is available, nothing outstanding. Expensive, too political, but the facilities are nice. It seems to focus too much on representing issues that aren't very important to the student bod. Expensive for private housing, not much Uni housing available. At least it is nice. It is like cheaper, better than London. Edinburgh is my favourite city in the world. They are incredibly cool and diverse, something for everyone. However, I feel the Uni doesn't support them very well."

Not fully satisfied with my courses and options for my degree. I have used the career hub mainly for finding part-time job adverts. They have been interesting and worthwhile in general; but different depending on the lecturers' skills and the course format. Satisfactory for a normal person with no disability, don't know about others. I used counselling services at Uni, reasonably good quality but not enough resource and very time consuming. I didn't have much experience with SU, expect for a couple of societies from EUSA. I live in the newest Uni accommodation, Holyrood Residence Halls. Though modern nad clean, it wasn't to my taste, especially the uncomfortable, huge and dirty common kitchen. It is both quiet and cosy and have enough activities to offer. Quite diverse,"

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat4,,rat5,non_app,Student Reviewer,02 Dec 16,Law and International Relations LLB (Hons), I am really enjoying myself. Edinburgh Uni really cares about its students. Even in 1st year there are opportunities to look at job prospects and options. Very interesting and engaging. Would love more places to sit between classes but the campus is beautiful. Personal tutors are very helpful and make you feel like your experience is important. Many great opportunities to get involved which is great as you feed connected with your peers. Beautiful city with so much to do! I love Edinburgh!

Uni has given me plenty of skills and the careers department is really helpful. The best thing about my course/lecturers is that we make my subject interesting to study. I haven't used it much but student support seems to be a well thought out and helpful system. The SU seems to be pretty good though I don't really know much about it.

One of my lecturers is hilarious. Otherwise they are pretty poor quality and unhelpful. Amazing library and good buildings Poor academic support (ie: personal tutors) and everything is a lot of hassle to sort out. Good facilities but I don't know what they really do. Good in a standard kind of sense, amazing food but quite a way to walk. Awesome - so much to do - lots of nightlife and clubs as well as cafes and restaurants. Lots to do again and generally very friendly welcoming people."

Being at Uni has given me a lot more to tell employees about myself in interviews. The lecturers are super enthusiastic about their subjects.

rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,02 Dec 16,Sociology and Politics MA (Hons)," Enjoyable and it has been an easy transition from high school. There are always updates on career fairs which are available. The course is interesting and builds on previous knowledge as the lectures are engaging. Able to meet with tutors when you request and there are a variety of services on offer for new and current students. Potterow is my favourite, but could be doing with a few mire booths. Easy to get around the city as it is smaller and you soon get to know where all the best places are. Variety of events for students and there is a society for everyone."

Throughout the year there are fairs, and loads of info about a variety of careers. The lecturers, what I am studying, everything really. Quite good, but some little improvement. Personally, it has been really good. Academically, you can have some good tutors, but also some uhelpful ones too. LOVE IT! It is an incredible city to embrace while studying my course.

rat4,non_app,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,," When some lecturers make the effort to do a good lecture. Very good facilities, but some cost quite a bit of money, ie: gym and music room. Not consistent. Some really good, some not so much. Expensive Nice city to live in. Very diverse. Need more support, financially and logistically (room booking etc)."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law LLB (Hons), All has been great except the lack of communication from the administration prior to arrival. Career services is great. Buildings are okay. Academic support is great. I don't know much about it. Private - pretty good.
rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat2,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,English Literature MA (Hons)," I enjoy the social aspect of Uni like plus my lectures in general, but when you need to know something non-academic, it is hard to know where to go. Lots of career talks / meetings etc. Like most of my lecturers, coursework sometimes feels brief. Don't personally feel the feedback is that helpful. Lots of facilities, don't know much about Student representation. When I lived in Uni accommodation it was lovely, just a bit far away. Edinburgh is amazing, it's vibrant and exciting but you can also find peace. Wide range"
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law LLB (Hons)," In second year the Uni has not spoken much about job prospects. Overall really like my lecturers this year. Not much feedback or if it is given, it is not clear. Food is a bit expensive but tasty, love the big cheese! Really enjoy the night life! Good there is a lot of variety."
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat1,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law LLB (Hons)," Made lots of friends and interested in my course, but I feel the support from the Uni is not adequate. Not mentioned often at all The friends I have made and it does interest me. Gym is great Absolutely shocking. A bit too strict in terms if evening events. Halls were nice, a bit too expensive and I have a nice flat this year. Love Edinburgh Hockey club aka Sports Union Club of the Year for years."
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,non_app,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Geography MA (Hons)," IT has been average, I don't love it, don't hate it. It doesn't live up to the hype. I am only first year. I haven't looked into much. It's interesting, opens to new ideas. The Uni is under a lot of construction just now. The Unions are good, I use them between lectures. My halls are good, however my flatmate left, other is on exchange, so I am a lot alone."
rat4,non_app,rat4,rat5,rat5,,non_app,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science BSc (Hons)," Good overall experience so far. Not used yet.

Lots of opportunities. Can't speak for all but in general excellent."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Linguistics MA (Hons)," Loads of fun, very educational and consistently engaging. Meeting cute boys! (But seriously knowledgeable tutors and lecturers). Very good Academic tutoring is great, and Uni health services are totally rad. Rooms and facilities are nice, but noise becomes a problem. Amazing Varied, inclusive and loads of fun."

rat5,non_app,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Classical Studies MA (Hons)," It has been amazingly good and I wish I could stay longer. I am only here for a semester so I haven't had much experience with this. Super interesting lectures, even when the topics seems boring. Standard facilities for a Uni, love the library most. All the support I have received has been great. The facilities are great and the representation seems good. Accommodation is close, affordable and very nice. Edinburgh is simply fantastic and such an exciting place to call home. There are so many cool societies for every possible interest or hobby."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,History of Art MA (Hons)," I love the city. All the people are so friendly from all age groups. Various emails about jobs and environment courses. Learning something new, I had never done my course before I got here. Great advertisement, always something going on. My accommodation is spacious, light and I have a bathroom to myself. I love the city, it is big enough to be exciting but small enough for you to run into friends if you run to. Hockey love it, so much to do, really love my team."
rat5,non_app,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,History MA (Hons)," I am an abroad student here for the semester. Lecturers are engaging and classes are applicable to real life! Pollock is a great place to live, the rooms and dinning halls are nice but it's a little far. Edinburgh is one of the highlights to attending University of Edinburgh, there is always something to do."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,,rat5,rat1,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,," Very good, satisfied with the teaching experience. I know we have career sessions, however as a first year I don't want to take someone 3rd or 4th year space up. Fab It is awful, windows do not close, furniture broken and the flat wasn't cleaned on arrival."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Chemical Engineering BEng (Hons)," Lots of nice people but a lot of work. Some lecturers don't explain enough Good library and gym Lots of study and support sessions Walls are a bit then.

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,History MA (Hons)," Good, things are ok. I get annoying spam emails about this. My lecturer and his knowledge of early modern coffee houses. Not bad, I am still alive. What you'd expect. Everybody seems to hate them but I am not sure why yet. Bit dodgy but it does the job! it's really old. There are loads... and some really random ones."

rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,," Good. No complaints. Not much just now, but I assume that is because I am in 1st year. There has been one careers night.

rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat2,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law and Spanish LLB (Hons)," Good social aspects and classes going well. Already employed. Most lecturers engaging and passionate. Library computers / study spaces always taken. Law pals -> good. Good that under 18s can be included as was 17 during freshers. Big cheese etc good. Quite run down, stained sofas, faulty oven / heater. Many sports clubs trials very unfair, did not even watch games therefore how could they know who to pick?"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law LLB (Hons)," Good Uni and good classes. There are a lot of events and career fairs on. Most are good and very engaging. But some boring one or people who refuse to use equipment. Good. However, could use more places to study / eat, etc. My personal tutor is lovely and very hrlpful. Seems good. Love it - Edinburgh is a great city. Not joined any but been to a couple of events, they seem good."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,,rat5,non_app,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Law LLB (Hons)," Uni is stressful (obv) but have met so many people. Some lecturers are clear and concise in what they are trying to teach. Good, library is always available for study space. Feedback is helpful. Prices can often be quite high. Very good clubs, lots of clubs, restaurants, etc."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,History MA (Hons)," Really enjoyed life at Uni, best thing I ever decided to do. My career hub - excellent facility. Very interesting - wide variety of courses was the reason I came to Edinburgh Uni. Library access excellent, also possible to work in SU, online facilities are very helpful. Great counselling service with relatively short waiting time, tutors readily available most of the time. Love the SU and spending time there, library bar could be better staffed at times (more staff). Beautiful city with lots to do, but the weather could be nicer. Some really fun club nights."

The opportunities to engage with academics and others - such as students - has allowed me to foster a network of possibilities. Clean and overall up to a adequate learning environment. I have gone though, 3 different personal tutors. Engaging and really supportive to students. View my responses to 'overall experience'."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Philosophy MA (Hons), It as been great! There seem to be lots of opportunities for help. The lectures are mostly super helpful. I live in a student housing co-operative which is lovely.

rat5,non_app,rat4,rat4,rat5,,non_app,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Veterinary Medicine BVMS," Edinburgh is amazing! and filled with such awesome people and things to do. It is all so interesting. Food Haven't really seen much of them so can't say much. Beautiful view, safe but food could be a bit better. AWESOME! So many bars / clubs to go to, live bars, jazz bars, etc. The intramural football team is filled with friendly and supportive people."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,," Really good, some of the lectures have made it difficult to understand the topics but everyone is really really nice. Loads of info and workshops etc. Interesting lecturers and current examples used in the topics, showing current research etc. Loads more feedback than anticipated which is great, lectures are super helpful, and there are loads of options for personal student support. Great facilities, loads of involvement and events. Modern, clean, all functions properly. Very hot. Everything is really close by and the independence is great. Loads of variety, loads of events."
rat1,rat3,rat2,rat2,rat2,,non_app,rat3,rat3,non_app,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science BSc (Hons)," Probably due to my misunderstanding what the situation at Uni would be but I find the lectures of tutorials a waste of time. I have no idea, I am a mature student and have worked for over 2 years, I do not need help to find a job at the moment. The best thing is my own effort of learning. I find the lectures of tutorials tiresome and unhelpful. There is a lot of construction being done at the moment which is causing lot of distraction to the movement of students. I feel there like I do not have much support despite dozens of emails daily. No idea. Not interested in the Student Union. I live in private accommodation and because of financial restraints I live in a pretty horrible apartment. Edinburgh is a nice place but there are better / interesting places in the world. Not interested in any societies."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,German and English Language MA (Hons)," I have loved my course which I applied for but formed outside courses too demanding. Good prospects - career fairs and networking readily available. Staff are very eager to help and tutorials are usually relevant and helpful. Excellent facilities, readily available regardless of demand. Academic and personal assistance available upon request. POsitive experience with both. An amazing SU. Facilities are beyond belief and awareness social issues is good. Good halls but rent is unreasonable A great balance of parties and high street / city centre. Good night life. Best part of my student experience. Many amazing societies, well funded."

rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,30 Nov 16,Astrophysics MPhys," Edinburgh has a good balance between social and academic. I have not done any of the employability activities. They are dedicated to their subjects/ Even though they do research, they are still excellent teachers. The facilities are all in a good condition and easily accessible. I have not met with my personal tutor too often but when I have it, it has been very helpful. Incredible facilities and the SU seems to be up to something always. Edinburgh is good with excellent facilities. There has been a slight security issue but it was resolved. Busting but not overrated. Very vibrant Lots of activities run by the societies and they are very engaging."

rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,29 Nov 16,Social Anthropology MA (Hons)," Very positive, hard work but I am having a fantastic time. Few direct efforts, but the facilities and groups are great. You can genuinely feel the excitement they have for their subject. It is amazing. Very good. Everything is more than fit to purpose. Academic support is good. No comment on personal (no used it)/ The SU elections are a poorly attended mess, but the facilities are top class. The flat is fine, but cold and with mice problem. Barely worth cost. Love Edinburgh, beautiful, clean, welcoming and it is incredibly cultured. All welcoming, engaging and worthwhile, made lots of friends."
rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,29 Nov 16,Economics and Politics MA (Hons)," Career service Course is interesting.

rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,29 Nov 16,Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons)," Great experience - needs more work to have more efficient Uni administration. Lots of workshops, especially for transferable skills. Interesting topics, great lectures. Great facilities, need more study spaces / give a list of available study spaces. Need more academic drop in sessions for subject content. Good student representation and involvement in social media. Private halls - easy to make friends, good food, well priced, many activities. Amazing - such a student oriented city, easy to get around, many things to do. Fun and super involvement."

rat2,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat1,,rat1,rat2,rat1,rat1,Student Reviewer,03 Jun 16,Politics MA (Hons)," My own interest in the subject has driven my desire. 
There is a large disparity between the perceived value of the University of Edinburgh brand and the actual service and education they give their students. Edinburgh is full of trade fares from large corporations such banks and insurance companies and much of the emphasis around campus is on these big companies.
The actual course provided no job specific preparation, there were no professional development modules.
The careers service is good and has a lot of information on prospective careers. The course and lecturers were engaging and covered a wide range of subjects. A'ight Feedback is very poor. tutors are very hard to get a hold of. My dissertation supervisor sometimes took weeks to reply. The student union is full of Torys Housing in Edinburgh is ridiculously high rent and is full of private landlords wanting to take advantage of students Banging mate Rugby club was full of torys"

Been minimal talk about job prospects but lots of careers events Interesting course, lecturers knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Very good.

We have careers talks every Wednesday lunch for my school, which are VERY helpful. The lecturers are so enthusiastic about their subject, so it is contagious! They make you want to study. I have everything I need at this university! Brill - All the support teams have been so helpful, and despite being here a month, they have helped me so much. They always hold events for every type of person. It is really good, all the staff are so lovely and approachable! The rooms are the perfect size too. Edinburgh is such a magical city, and being part of such a vibrant city is amazing. Every type of sport is on offer here, curling, skiing, volleyball etc; then you have tea societies, academic etc."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA French and Linguistics," This is an excellent university, which has gathered some truly inspiring minds. Very limited availability."
rat3,rat2,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Sociology," While the lecture and course materials in honours are quite good, I found the first two years too broad and less interesting. For the support, it feels like the university is more interested in making sure students don't drop out as it would negatively affect ratings rather than their well-being"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Software Engineering," Worth studying here! Lots of companies searching for undergraduates The course is quite hard to adjust at first, but later it is quite easy. New iMacs, library is excellent Not the quality that you would expect for 105 pounds per week. Fridge is a bit leaking and room is quite small Super nice city, no crimes, lots of pubs, enjoying a nightlife quite a lot Did not find snooker and billiards society, so will create my own."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," Uni is pretty good, my decision to come here was probably the best in my life."

University of Edinburgh is a world-class university. Overall great presentation of the material with some lecturers lacking interaction with the auditorium. All facilities are perfect quality, although sometimes the online student portal seems confusing. Advice for almost every matter you can imagine. Very helpful, friendly and communicative. Sociable, friendly and international environment that is great for studying as well. A variety of places to go, combined with a multicultural and enriching atmosphere. Great variety of interests and hobbies to chose from. Societies are really open-minded and friendly."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Political Work," This university is the university of life. Sitting in the city tailored for students more than tourists, Edinburgh University combines all it has learnt in the past 500 years to develop the best experience for students. good good and diversified well developed good may have some politics. but already good enough clean and hospitable best city to live and study at is edinburgh Politics and International Relations Society, Leviathan Magazine, are the best political groups of students"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Ecological and Environmental Sciences with Management BSc (Hons)," University with high profile, but still need improvements.

rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," The University Life in Edinburgh is great, probably better than expected. All the courses are well organised and the atmosphere is great. Accommodation is very good, especially self-catered Pollock Halls that provide well cooked food. Lots of Clubs, Museums, landscapes, architecture..."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Civil Engineering," The University of Edinburgh is a very welcomming, open minded, educational, oportunity rich place that offers plenty of social atmosphere and provides good courses with teachers who know what they are talking about. One also has a big selection of extracuricular activities which I use plenty and enjoy a lot. I like being there."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics, The University of Edinburgh is an excellent university. The Mathematics department is very friendly and well-organized. There is always someone to go to if you need help. Students here are generally fun and interesting with many interests. I've learnt a lot about foreign countries since I came here.
rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics with Finance MA (Hons), The University of Edinburgh provides excellent teaching as well as opportunities to develop as professionals. The environment encourages learning. The city of Edinburgh in itself is a great setting for cultural and professional development.
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electric Electronic Engineering, Then university of Edinburgh is a good university thich provide profound facilities and opportunities.I gain knowledge through the various couses and activities.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computing Science," There is some areas that need improvement,but overall a very solid pick for university. One of the best universities to kick-start your professional career. Course is well structured and the lecturers are on decent level Exceptional facilities,absolutely modern and fully functional My contacts with the students support are very limited in number,but strongly positive as experience No direct observations Everything necessary is provided Sort of boring Various choices for clubs and societies,there is something for everyone's liking"
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Medical Sciences, There are interesting courses and great facilities in all sites. Nice Student Union (they provide us with heart-melting service).
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," There are some minor problems (mainly lecturers and heating of some accommodations), but overall I'm very happy with the university. The program of study is quite good, the city is very nice and there's a lot of people to meet and have fun with. There are a lot of companies that come and give lectures in the university in search of future employees. It can be very easy to get at least to the interview stage with them if you give them a CV. The program of study is very good, but some of the lecturers lack in pedagogical skills. The facilities don't lack anything you might need, in my opinion, and everything is straightforward with using most of them. If you are in trouble with something, there is always an some organisation / person to help you with it. Haven't had that much experience with it, but I've heard mostly good things about it. Mostly good, there are some problems with heating though. The city is very beautiful and lively. The weather can sometimes be a bit discouraging but you'll get used to it. There's basically a society for everything that you can think of and most of them are pretty well organised and with lots of nice people to meet. Nightlife is very good and clubs are always full."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,English Literature," There is a great diversity of lectures and subjects, which give us many opportunities.

rat3,rat2,rat2,rat2,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science and Electronics BEng (Hons)," There is a great variety of skills taught by the different courses. However, there are some aspect regarding the accommodation and the university which can be improved further."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Politics, This is a very good and warm university. There're many good professors and many things to do on campus (and at home).
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Maths and computer science," The University is great. It is situated in a beautiful city, the accommodations are nearby the uni, relatively cheap. There are many societies and sports clubs meaning there is something for everyone. Since the University is very large, how good the courses and degree are depends on which department one studies in."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BSc Comp. Sc. and Maths," The university is much better than I have expected to be. The course is very different compared to some other universities in England, but well structured. Also I do not have to pay tuition fees as I am an Italian citizen."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Medicinal and Biological Chemistry," The university is on a top level in the world. The facilities are great, the staff is great, everything is awesome."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Law, The university is very open to all backgrounds and paths of study.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science with Electronics, The University is wonderful. Full of facilities and labs for students. The classrooms are always big and comfortable. Every broken thing is repaired in a couple of days and the canteen is excellent.
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,computer science," The university life is great and other than a few inconveniences is doing a great job. while we do hear a lot about job opportunities, there is rarely a chance to hear about the talents a company is looking for in particular. They are very good but not challenging enough in some aspects. There are not enough free recreational facilities on campus. The accommodation itself is very good but pantries are not very well stocked and there is not enough common room space."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Econ 1, The weather does need a bit of work but overall pretty good. JMCC food needs a bit more variety
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,History, The university staff are really supportive and helpful if i need any help. The are also a very large range of societies that I was able to get involved with really easily. University facilities in the academic buildings and the student union are all clean and well equipped.
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA (Hons) Sustainable development," The university provides very good facilities (library, lecture rooms, lecture theatres, erc.). Of course there are some which are older and with poorer quality but overall the quality is more than satisfactory. Me degree and choice of course is broad and quite diverse which make it possible to shape your own interests in courses. It is also valuable that we have very devoted lecturers and especially the people involved in our degree programme. The city is also nice, there are places to visit, plus a nice atmosphere during Christmas market time, for example. Some very enthusiastic and good lecturers. Wide variety of courses available to choose from."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," The University of Edinburgh provide it's students with very good environment in which students can develop and expand their knowledge and understanding in each subject. There are outside courses and all kinds of opportunities designed for helping them. If you are the person wanting to learn and striving to understand how things work, this is the place for you! Almost every week there are organized presentations and talks from different companies interested into finding bright representatives from our university. The University of Edinburgh provides it's students with very good environment for personal development no matter what specialty they are. There is a project called PeerSuport made by the university that include all kinds of sub projects orientated for the different study disciplines. For instance for Computer Science students, there are MathPals and InfPals, who actually are students usually into their second or third year, who help lower-year-students to understand better the material. There are many and different societies."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," The University of Edinburgh is probably one of the best places to study. It has everything a student needs - numerous societies, extremely colourful city life, amazing uni-facilities and good lecturers. In addition, it is one of the most prominent universities in the world so being a student here will make your life easier when you apply for jobs."
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,environmental studies," The University of Edinburgh is in a fabulous location of an old historical city surrounded by beautiful architecture in a very student oriented society. There is some level of individual attention and personalization by the university with their inclusion of many clubs and societies as well as each students access to a personal tutor. However, too much emphasis is put on the student to learn outside the class rendering the lectures somewhat useless and resulting in a shaky understanding of the material. All of the lecturers were knowledgable and very charismatic about their areas of study but the classes themselves were not structured in the most conducive way to promote learning. There is too much emphasis on outside reading, which is not structured enough to keep all students on the same page of general knowledge on the course. Each student is awarded a personal tutor, who can be incredibly helpful to assist on an individual basis. However, not all tutors put in the same amount of effort to reach out to students as others. University accommodation is decent, with cleaners every week included. The city of Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and thus has a very lively night life and many options for activities and restaurants/shops to visit during the day, as well as plenty of historical sites and museums that are free to access. The University of Edinburgh has a huge emphasis on clubs and societies which are the best way to socialize with the rest of the student population, they plan many events and tend to meet weekly, and are highly supported by the university."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BSc Biomedical Sciences (Neuroscience)," The University of Edinburgh is an outstanding academic institution which gives you numerous opportunity to meet people from all over the world, to be taught and mentored by some the most famous cutting-edge scientist and to develop leadership and organisational skills. This was the best choice of a university for my undergraduate degree which I could have possibly made. I will remember every minute of this wonderful journey!"
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Psychology MA," The University of Edinburgh is an amazing place to study, grow and explore. The staff is supportive and positive. The research and prospects for engagement in it are limitless. For an interested student are doors are practically open to a world of science and opportunities. There are many opportunities for feedback from the staff. There are also interesting student societies which can support you and entertain you and help you grow as a person. EUYSRA is a unique project originating from the University of Edinburgh which helps undergraduate students start their own research projects during their first years of studies, it even provides funding and academic support to members. The International Student Centre in which I have been involved for three years is a vibrant place for international students which makes the university more than a Scottish university. it makes it a great hub of nationalities, cultures and religions. Edinburgh University's main characteristic would be """"international"""". The feeling of being in the centre of the world, while being far north near the Highlands is a unique one for this place. I haven't been able to see what my job prospects are yet so I am conservative in my grading. The academic staff at the university is excellent and is producing world-class research. This is inspiring and there are many opportunities for the undergraduates to take part and benefit from the on-going research at the university. The courses load is well structured and the ration assignments-final exams is good. However, the requirements and study objectives are not always clear. A good researcher not always translates into a good lecturer and teacher. Thus, independent study is a crucial part of studying at this university. Taking on the responsibility of your education and making the most of the extracurricular opportunities on offer can take you a long way. The university provides perfect facilities for student. The Main Library is a convenient and cosy place to study. Computer labs are open 24 hours a day. There is specialized software available for free to psychology students. Labs are bookable for experimental sessions. The undergraduate might feel restricted in the first two years, however, until they find themselves around the facilities. Student support can vary. It depends to whom you turn to. I have had personal tutors who are not likely to help me but I have found help in places I haven't expected it. There are people at the university who are devoted to making student life easier. Student support officers and undergraduate directors might be intimidating names but the people behind them have done wonders for me in the hardest of times. The university accommodation facilities for 1st years are excellent. There is a full-catered centre (Pollock Halls) where I used to stay in my first year. This place feels like home and this is achieved through the hard work of staff who are paid to supervise, organize activities and break the ice between people. Events and opportunities to socialize are perfect at the university accommodation centres. Edinburgh is an exciting place to live in. It is a world heritage (UNESCO) city and has many landmarks. It is beautiful without doubt. The night life is safe and the large student population means that you will be surrounded by like-minded young people at most clubs and bars. However, the diversity of night life is not excellent and also going out can be quite expensive. The university has an excellent array of societies and clubs. The variety is amazing. For four years I am still surprised by a new society each year and I always find something new."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," The University of Edinburgh is a worm and welcoming place for the young bright minds of Europe. With over 1/3 of International students, you will feel at home no matter where you come from. Edinburgh is one of the top rated university in the world, and the quality of teaching justifies this! Students are followed in weekly small - groups tutorial and there are dozens of way the University supports us"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics, The University of Edinburgh is a wonderful place.

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Visiting Student to Humanities and Social Science," The University of Edinburgh is a very attractive university with friendly and knowledgeable teachers and competitive students. The societies are fascinating, esp. some societies with unique British features, such as Harry Potter society. Facilities are excellent as well. I enjoyed my stay here a lot. However, I had some conflicts with my landlord, which is a private student accommodation company that signed contract with the uni, and I am not very satisfied with their behaviour several times. Therefore, I gave a rating of 4."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Ecological and Environmental Sciences," The University of Edinburgh has one of the most vibrant student communities - with a wide range of student societies, and some of the evening lecture series such as the ones organized by the Sustainability Department."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,International Relations," The university of Edinburgh is a great place for International students to study. I have been having such a great time here with my friends. However, student support system should be changed a bit in a good way."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,History, The organization of the course and the lectures is really good as there is a variety of topics we are talking about and you can always learn something new. The city life is amazing as you can walk around for hours and there is much to see. I have a really positive opinion regarding the Students' Union as the people there are always welcoming and their work is efficient.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,chemical engineerig," the student support is good. cheap beer in union. it is very cold here.Though I'm from Glasgow, the weather is still unbearable. Anyway, I love the uni. Hope u would enjoy it."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics," The things I particularly enjoy as a student here are the huge diversity of courses and subjects and basically the freedom to choose anything you want. The second thing is the support from lecturers, tutors, other students and a lot of teamwork is involved."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Signal Processing and Communications MSc," The topics discussed in the lectures are quite challenging and interesting. The accommodation is quite expensive, but the conditions are good. In my opinion, regarding job prospects is more difficult to find a job, if you are not from the European Union but overall, the city and especially the university are top quality."
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,English Literature and French," The tutorials are quite useful as they prepare us well for the exams. The conditions in the accommodation are good - however, sometimes the prices and the location are not amazing and especially if it is far away from the campus, then it takes a lot of time to be in it."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Sciense, The uni is great.I am really really happy with my course and the overall experience.It is even better then my expectation which were high. It is not hard to find job. The lectures are great especially the flipped classroom ones.The lecturers are really good. The library is great. We also have special labs which are very good and the sports center is unique. It strong organisation. My accommodation is great but a bit expencive. Good but not as good as Glasgow for example. there is great choice of clubs and societies and all I am part of are great!
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics and Mathematics MA (Hons)," The university accommodation is not suitable for students who want a more close-knit community. The university campus is also spread-out throughout the city, so there is almost no campus life either."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science, The university developed my problem solving mindset. Everything essential is provided. And the CompSoc society was so useful for me. The city is amazing as there is so much to see and visit here. The staff is very supportive and helpful and is relatively easy to find a part time job.
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics and Politics MA (Hons)," The university facilities are in excellent quality, but the main problem is that sometimes if not quite often, it is not easy to find a spare seat (especially in the library). Furthermore, the accommodation is expensive and some accommodations are far away from the campus which is a problem if you have an early lecture."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Software Engineering & Artificial Intelligence," The university has always been in the top places for Informatics in the past years, so I am very happy to be studying here. I think it's pretty much living up to the expectations. Besides, the city itself is a beautiful place to live in and there's usually lots to do."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Religion Studies, The university is absolutely great! I am happy to be here.

rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Law," Studying here is completely different from high school. You have so many opportunities here, the library is amazing as you can find any book there and there is always someone who can help you if you have trouble with something."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics, The accommodation in my opinion is quite cheap and the conditions are good. The university facilities are great and being a part from a society is also a wonderful experience. I have met a lot of new people and both the city and the university are amazing places.
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA Psychology," The best thing about studying here was meeting some incredibly ambitious, intelligent people. Edinburgh Uni certainly provides the right conditions for knowledge to flourish, and satisfies our intellectual curiosity. I guess that depends more on your degree rather than solely the name of the university. I am yet to see how things will work out for me. :) Interesting couse material.The lecturers are experts in their field. Modern and comfortable. The Counselling team is very helpful. I only wish the waiting time wasn't so long. Teviot is the best! I lived in self-catered accommodation (Hermit's Croft) in my first year and loved it! Cozy, clean, located not far away from the central campus. Edinburgh is uniquely beautiful. There's a lot of history and multiple forms of entertainment. Huge choice."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Architectural History, The classes are interesting and there's lots of intriguing things to do. It's a really pretty city. Living here is such a joy!

rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Physhology," The lectures' material is very relevant and there are lots of potential jobs. Interesting practical show how lecture information is actually used in real research. The accommodation is really expensive and even if a meal is included, the price is just too high. The university facilities are really good, although it is difficult to find a seat in the library. Career service was really helpful regarding job prospects. The good thing is that the university has a high rate of graduate employment."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biblical Studies," The thing I thing that needs improvement if I have to outline a single one is related to the university facilities. It would be much better if we have more spacious reading rooms. I started looking for a job and with the support from the university, it should not be hard to find one."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science, The uni is in a nice location and has plenty of courses to offer. It is a lot of work but i imagine it seperates edinburgh from other universities Some tutors barely speak english.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences with Management BSc (Hons)," The university has a good, welcoming atmosphere.

The university values our opinions, likes engaging with the students and likes to keep us informed about what is going on."

rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Applied Mathematics BSc (Hons), The university is great.

rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics & Bioelectronics, The course is very slow at the moment and the quality of students goes from very smart to abysmal. So far it looks promising Some lecturers are amazing some are absolutely awful. The course is slow and not engaging enough. Amazing I've had help when I needed it. Don't really know much about them but they seem okay Very good but a bit on the expensive side. Again very good but expensive There are societies for everything
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BEng Computer Science," The courses are challenging but very interesting.The lecturers go through the material in great detail making it easy for students to understand it.The city of Edinburgh is a beautiful, calm place with many things to see. There are plenty of opportunities for work or internships."

There are so many courses which you can choose from and therefore to study exactly what you want. Except from the lectures, there are tutorials, labs which prepare us additionally. Furthermore, the city is really beautiful as there are so much to see here, especially during the festival or Christmas."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics and Computer Science MEng (Hons)," The labs for the courser are really useful and furthermore they give you a lot of experience of what you are learning, which is the most important aspect. The thing I like about my accommodation is that there is food included and the city life is great! I think some of the lecturers are great as they are funny and teach the course very well."

If I have to outline a single thing that I do not like, are the prices of the accommodation here, which are just too high for most of us."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat2,,rat2,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Social Policy and Economics MA (Hons), student support may enhance

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Medical Electives," One of the most amazing cities I have ever visited for many reasons. There is so much to see, while you are going around the beautiful parks and even in the campus."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Civil Engineering," Overall great university. UoE's carreer service has many departments ready to help and the university itself offers part-time jobs to university students. Most lecturers are fantastic, but there are some that aren't engaging. Great facilities. My Personal Tutor is great and always willing to help. Also all lecturers have surgery hours if you have any questions and there are facilities that provide help if you need any. I don't really know much about the students' union. I was staying at Beaverbank Place for my 1st year and it was a great accommodation overall, but it was a bit expensive and about 30 minutes away from campus by foot. Lots to do. Many societies and clubs and it is fairly easy to create your own society, if there are enough people interested."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Theoretical Physics," Overall, I am happy with my course and the education that my University provides. I feel like I am developing useful skills and that I am getting to know better how society works through different experiences. The facilities, seminars, clubs and accommodation offer good experiences. I think the prestige of The University of Edinburgh opens many doors. I like the structure of my course and some of my lecturers but there are some other lecturers that are not very helpful. I believe that they are trying their best to provide us with different necessary facilities. The buildings are modern but my building is too loud for my liking because people party too much. I don't like the fact that most of the time it is cloudy, windy and it is raining outside. Edinburgh is quite expensive for what you get. But it is a beautiful city. There are plenty of Clubs & Societies to join and they organise social events."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BEng Computer Science," Personally, I am having a fantastic time, studying, whilst meeting new people, whilst bettering myself in every way I see fit. The University as a whole is great. A brilliant study and social space! The career service (MyCareerHub) provides quite a lot of local opportunities. I have, however, not yet tried its effectiveness, to state a full opinion. Courses are quite well laid out. And the lecturers are friendly, as well as helpful.There is always room for improvement. But I believe the university manages to promote such improvement, in general. Fantastic learning environment. All facilities (at least the ones I have entered) were well equiped for the necessary tasks. I have had some contact with the teaching offices around the university, and they do their job. But there is room for improvement, as sometimes they recieve much more than they can handle in a short period of time (After exams, etc) I have not, yet been in contact with the Students' Union apart from knowing their existance. I have, however not really wanted to do so, either way. Responce time, regarding issues with accomodation could be slightly better. The conditions as a whole, however, I find fitting and quite nice. Quite a lot going around in the City of Edinburgh. Lots of things to do and people to meet. University life can be as social as you want it to be! Finding a fitting student society is easy, and spending time with them is great fun. It's all about finding the right one for yourself."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Physics, Really enjoying my life in Edinburgh Uni. Professors are top-tier and are easily approachable. Clean facilities. The best part is the library- quiet and quite a few books in selection. The workload is challenging but doable. I like the idea of phd students helping out when us students are in need of help (the use of piazza and Mathsbase). Big thumbs up! N/A Great library. Nice and cozy temperature. N/A Don't care. Loud at night. Partier upstairs. Beautiful city and nice people. What more do you want? Almost as good as Tokyo. Joined the physics society. Great people.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,German," Regarding most aspects, the teachers are knowledgeable and clear. Furthermore, the tutorials are a great way to crystallize and clarify the class. In my opinion, the accommodation where I live is a way overpriced, but the city is amazing in every single aspect. Regarding the university facilities, The Old College needs some interior renovation. A lot of clubs and societies are provided, but it is not easy to find a free time for many."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics, Studying at the University of Edinburgh is definitely one of the best choices I have ever made. I would recommend this University to every student who would ask my advice.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics and Electrical Engineering," One thing I also have to mention is that it's a really international university. As I have lived in an international environment my whole life this is also something that I would look for in a university. All the events and societies as well as all friends I have made here make me think I could not have done the same in another university and that I have made the only possible right choice in coming to Edinburgh. There are job adverts in every Uni building I can think of and apart from that there are some societies that help with that too. And some of them look pretty amazing... If I wasn't a sometimes bored first year student not yet learning anything at all this would be a 5. Most lecturers are cool, smart and funny though so it can still be rewarding to go to lectures. Same goes for tutors. One thing that puts me off about this University is how far away King's Buildings, George Square and accommodation are apart from each other. The facilities themselves are great though. So far I managed to get good help whenever I actually needed it... A lot of the events they organize are weekly, but I found some more interesting ones for myself as well and so far found them worth going to. Pollock Halls is great, laundry isn't too expensive, the food is usually good (in my opinion, anyway) and living more or less together with thousands of students is also great. I have a strong dislike for nightclubs (which there are enough of even for those who do), but there's still stuff to do for me. Apart from Uni events there's pubs and ceilidhs among many things to try out here. Not to mention how ridiculously nice people here are... They're great for entertainment and jobs, and that's really all I want/expect from them."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Software engineering," Overall a great university, although some departments are really lacking in funds compared to others. Student-institution communication could use some improvement."
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science, Overall experience from the Uni is good. There is room for improvement but you cant have it all.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat1,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,economics," overall happy here, students union serious lack of support and lack of information over events"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Artificial Intelligence, Overall I am satisfied with the University of Edinburgh. The staff and facilities are very good. I would recommend it to a friend.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Geography," Overall I would rate my university experience highly, however I don't know much about job prospects or student support so I cannot really say anything about it."
rat2,rat3,rat1,rat2,rat2,,rat3,rat2,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Psychology," Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at the University of Edinburgh. I am very satisfied with the teaching as well as the facilities so far. Courses are clearly outlined and lectures are interesting as well as well explained. Emails regularly remind students of deadlines and activities, which is particularly important to first-year students who have just began their university experience. Unexpectedly, I believe my current workload is lower than at high school. Perhaps the workload could be slightly higher with more challenging tasks. Nevertheless, I am unable to generalize this to every course."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Art," Overall, I really enjoy the University of Edinburgh and the wonderful opportunities available to me at the College of Art. The student life is great as there is always something to do on every night of the week."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," Overall, it is a Great university, pretty much has everything you need or would want."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Psychology," Overall, the university is good. I really dislike the fact that is way too academic. Especially the social sciences. There's nothing practical. We are being taught only theories and we don't have any real life experiences. The library is great. Maybe that's my favourite thing about the university. Their book collection is fantastic."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat2,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Veterinary medicine," Pretty great university, fantastic social life stuff, looks good on a CV to come from Edinburgh uni Theyre never open for vets"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Applied Mathematics (BSc Hons)," It prove to be a great decision to go to The University of Edinburgh. The student life is great, both in terms of academics and also social life. There is really a support from the staff and I do believe I am taking part in an innovative project which is our university. Not to mention the city, as Edinburgh is definitely one of the most beautiful cities in the United Kingdom and in the world. I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to study abroad or in their own country, Scotland."
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat1,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Accounting and Finance MA (Hons)," It probably depends on the degree, but there are many assignments, homework and tests you have to do every week. Furthermore, this goes along with reading so I hardly find time for societies and sport clubs as my day is busy anyway."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Psychology and Business Studies, It's a great university but certainly some areas could be improved.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Linguistics and English Language MA (Hons), It's good
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,mathematics and stastistics, More team work than high school. Have more reading test. The grade not only depend on the final exam but also homeworks and tutorials.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Neuroscience BSc (Hons), Most of the lectures' content is interesting. There is a lot to do in the city (like cinemas). Sometimes there are not enough free spaces in the main library. The students' union is always friendly. And finding a job is fairly easy and the university also helps us regarding this. My overall opinion about the university is very positive.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Chemical Physics," I've been living in Edinburgh for five months, now. Never been happier!The city is awesome: full of beautiful historical monuments and buildings, rich in clubs, pubs, theatres and cinemas and everything is done for the students! The university facilities are stunning, modern and always perfectly working! The learning system is one of the best in the world, innovative and interactive!"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,HISTORY BA (HONS)," Leaving home can be a tough experience and the lifestyle change can really hit you. But meeting so many nice people has made the journey not as scary as you might expect and it’s great living in a city like Leeds. I have a work placement in 2nd year which will help me with future job prospects. For students who are unsure about what they will do after graduation, there are talks and conferences which reassure students that this feeling if normal and there is information they can seek out about careers. The course itself is very interesting as well as the people you meet during your time here. The tutorials are really interactive and you get a real insight in other people’s thoughts as there is a good platform for debate in these sessions. However, the lecture classes are far too big so there is not enough individual focus. The quality of teaching can vary depending on the lecturer, some talk too quickly, some are monotonic. Scheduled lectures are also too spread out across the week; I would prefer to have a day off. Excellent. I am part of a tutor group and can meet with my personal tutor at any time. There is also a support team who work in my accommodation who you can approach with any problems you have about your living, flatmates, and even directions on how to get home if you are stranded late somewhere and need to get home. I do not involve myself with the SU. I pay £100 a week for self-catered halls, the rooms are good quality and the general area is very pretty. The problem I have with student accommodation is that they do not enquire about your character or personality so you are paired with flatmates who may not have anything in common with and it can be difficult to live and get along with them. Edinburgh is a really nice city and there are places which are great for nightlife. You can find most things you need on one street so it is easy to get around. I have joined the psychology society who are planning a trip to Amsterdam, I have already signed up for this. The Raising & Giving society do so many good things for charity; there is a charitable trip to Uganda and a chance to go mountain climbing to raise awareness."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics and Mathematics MA (Hons)," Love this university, would highly recommend but its quite competitive. Very diverse student body and an amazing city to live in. Top notch. Excellent lecturers and broad range of courses. Incredible. Several libraries with thousands of collections, labs, help desks, buildings all over the city, Excellent help facilities, at least in the Economics and Mathematics courses. The most disappointing aspect of the university I find, as the Students' Union doesn't really ask us what we want improved, or implement those improvements. Felt very safe, range of en-suite and regular sized rooms, great location. Excellent pubs, clubs and cultural things to choose from. Very diverse range of societies but there are not very charities you can take part in."

rat5,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Architecture," I'm generally happy with my university choice and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, the city's absolutely beautiful and the people here are splendid. The courses are very self directed and could use with a bit more teaching since we're students and we don't actually know what we're doing, but it teaches you to be independent"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Politics and International Relations," it is definitely a great university worth to come. I'm a visiting student studying here for a year and this year must be the year that I would never forget. The classes in gym, the colourful life of societies, the amazing lectures and tutorials and the beautiful sightseeings in Scotland. And UoE really have helped me to improve the abilities to study and review by myself."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,English literature," Lecutures are both thought provoking and fun. Like it very much. Lecturers and tutors are quite nice and responsible. After class disscussion of works and essays available. The evaluaion of course works is objective and subject to high academic standard. Afterall, a very useful studying experience to be added to your CV."
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science with Management Science," Many of the scholars in the uni are more cut to be researchers than lecturers and tutors. So the organizational aspect of university is not the greatest one. However, everyone is considerate and helping. There are many social and interpersonal activities that both the university and the city provide. renowned uni; great future prospects somehow poorly organized could be better organized but everyone is considerate and helping i am not using uni accom but my friends who are are fine with it edinburgh is a beautiful city with a lot of prospects big diversity of clubs and societies with numerous activities"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Maths and Physics, I think the facilities are very good
rat4,rat2,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences (Biochemistry) BSc (Hons)," I think the university accommodation is very convenient. There should be more shuttle buses, especially in the morning and evening."
rat2,rat1,rat2,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat2,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,French and English Literature MA (Hons)," I was originally attracted to Edinburgh because of the beautiful city and the high ranking of '17th best' in the world. While the city has never disappointed, I've failed to see any proof of the uni's high ranking. Lectures are not engaging and most students do not speak up in tutorial groups. I will be leaving after my first year. rarely engaging Not very pretty on the outside, but functional and nice on the inside rarely any hot water Chose the uni for the city"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics and Statistics BSc (Hons), I would definitely reccommend University of Edinburgh to deciding students.Edinburgh is a very friendly city and the individual schools want to guarantee students as satisfied as possible.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," I would highly recommend the University of Edinburgh, especially for the city and cultural life. As well as your degree, you'll have another kind of education here."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat2,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Social and Architectual History, I would like to nominate Professor Ian Campbell for the university Lecturer of the Year because he is extremely helpful and always has time for you.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Politics," I’m so glad that I come to this university! I spend the best time in my life here. There're so many intriguing experiences, so much laughter and tears. I went to audit tons of lectures and most of them are awesome. I made life-long friends here and we shared so many stories that I will never forget. The societies provided us with surprise everyday and the city is already ready for us to explore. To conclude, this is just perfect! A lot of job information is provided online which help us to gain more experience in future career. Most of the courses in social science are really intriguing. But there're a few boring ones. Uni facilities are advanced. Organizations for supporting and advising is everywhere and they are all willing to help. Members of Students’ Union are Warm-hearted. Absolutely love pollock hall (the University Accommodation) where we have had so much fun! But the cost is a bit high. Edinburgh is an amazing city that worth exploring and learning!! Tons of options in societies and the members are friendly."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BSc Applied Mathematics," If I have to outline the things that I particularly enjoy in the university - they are many. First of all, the library and the other facilities are great - giving us the opportunity to study and to prepare for the other exams. Secondly, they are numerous societies and clubs, which can help you in a variety of ways. They can support you academically, they organize a lot of social events, sport events, you can meet a lot of new people and make new friends. The city is amazing and I particularly enjoy being student in Edinburgh because there are not so many clubs and other places for night life, so I can focus on my studies which are my priority. This is only my first year in the University but I enjoy the life and being a student here as there a lot of opportunities for me."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,History, If you want to spread your wings and fly then reach for the stars!

It also has a wide veriety of clubs and societies to choose from. I've already recomended it to friends and helping some of them with the admision.

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Social Anthropology," In terms of support services, I wanna say that the disability service could be improved. More individual care is needed.I wanna nominate Professor Anthony Allison for the university Lecturer of the Year because he helped me beyond all other lecturers, with Disability issues."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Philosophy and Theology MA (Hons)," Incredible city, with a high academic standard and wonderful facilities, would reccommend to anybody"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences," It was fairly easy transitioning from high school to university. Lectures were fascinating, studying for the courses did not consume all of my time, and I had the opportunity to try out a lot of new activities through the societies, where I also connected with several new friends. The city is a veritable open air museum, with dozens of fascinating and breathtakingly beautiful places to visit. The University of Edinburgh is one of the universities with the highest employment rates after graduation in the UK. It also has a careers service and provides students with the necessary skills for them to find a job through the courses. My course starts by covering a broad range of topics, is taught by fascinating lecturers, and offers lots of hands-on experience through practicals and labs. The city is also a major bonus, being very multicultural and vibrant without being overwhelming. The university's facilities are excellent, from the libraries to the cafes and from the labs to the lecture theatres. Support is provided to students with physical disabilities or otherwise, as well as to students with financial problems, difficulties studying, and personal and medical issues. This support is provided bot by the university itself and by the students' association. Students receive regular notifications on the services available. The Students' Union is very active. It deals with a broad spectrum of matters, ranging from the prices at the cafes to equality and non-discrimination. It reaches out to the students through activities, regular updates and notifications, and gives students a chance to voice their opinions through an elaborate suggestion site and questionnaires. The UoE is traditionally a student-oriented university and respects the opinions of its students. The accommodation is very modern, albeit in an inconvenient location - far from the centre and my campus. Other accommodation sites are more central, however they are more antiquated. The best thing about Edinburgh is that there's an endless supply of activities. From walking along the cobble-stoned Royal Mile to climbing up Arthur's Seat, and from going on haunted ghost tours to having a hot chocolate in the Elephant House (where JK Rowling famously wrote some of the Harry Potter books), there's a thing for everyone in this amazing city. Scottish Dance Society, Harry Potter Society, Quidditch team."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics and Electrical Engineering with Management," I feel to be part of this university. The student community in Edinburgh is fantastic. Of course, you can always encounter a bad tutor/reader, but it can happen at any university. My overall experience so far is just great. I see bright future for myself due to this fantastic university. The only downside are the prices of the flats in Edinburgh."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," I like the university and the city as well. The facilities are great, and I am especially impressed by the library and the gym."

rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Politics and sociology," I think it has been good. I wish to have, perhaps, better feedback on essays though."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economic history, Great university. Amazing city and nightlife. The place you want to be both for studying and for having fun!
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat2,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Chemical Engineering," Great university. Since it is in the heart of the city, everything you could want is within walking distance. Not a big fan of my course but the lecturers are nice."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Civil engineering, High quality education
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics," Highly cultural city with loads to do, great academic stimulation with large variety of extra curricular activities (societies, volunteering, outreach teams, reading groups)"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Theoretical Physics, I am basing my rating on my satisfaction on the education that I am receiving. Overall I am happy with my degree and the syllabus and I believe that if I get good marks I will have plenty opportunities for further studies or job prospects. I believe that The University of Edinburgh is very prestigious and anyone with this name on their degree has good opportunities for jobs. I like the course structure but sometimes I don't like the lecturers or their lecture notes. I believe that the university tries hard to find ways to provide us with many different facilities so I am quite happy with this. Same as above. My support is provided by some of my lecturers/tutors. I don't really pay attention to them so I cannot express any opinion. The current building I am staying in is very modern and spacious but it is also very loud for my liking because people party too much. I don't like the fact that most of the time it is grey outside and it is very windy or it rains. I think Edinburgh is an expensive city especially now that I am looking at flats for next year. There are plenty of Clubs & Societies to join if you have time and they organise socials and events.
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Master of Arts with Honours Russian Studies and European Union Studies," I am generally happy with my university. However, as I have been doing language courses, I would recommend organizing more contact hours that will give students chance to practice more (this to include grammar tutorials, discussion groups and conversation classes). In addition to that, introducing more group projects could be considered very useful because it allows establishing study groups etc."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,International Business," I am having the time of my life in The University of Edinburgh. Friends, study, work, experience all sums up to the LIFE I want to live. I encounter problems everyday but this student life is getting me through all of it. I would definitely recommend this university to people who want to live a very well balanced life. There are so many opportunities to learn from. Large business organisation do not hold recruitment programs in all the university in the UK. It does so only in a few selected universities. This says a lot. Excellent teaching method. Enjoying the course a lot. Everything about the university is excellent. Cafes everywhere in the campus, printing points, help desks, etc. The University and student union has so many helplines and support services. I am from India and the ways here are very different but the support provided by the university helped me settle in Edinburgh very quick. They have a free and fair election to start of with. All opinions are considered. I wasn't expecting Pollock Halls to be so good. I am sure that the university is going above and beyond to provide such service. Wish I could stay here for my whole degree. One reason I picked Edinburgh as the city of study was that it is the perfect student city. I never take the bus no matter how far the destination is because the weather is amazing and you do not realise how much you have walked until and unless you look at google maps. If the clubs and societies weren't so good I wouldn't have joined 8 societies."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electrical Engineering," I am mostly satisfied by my university experience. One thing I would change is the range of courses provided for each degree. At the moment there is little flexibility on that, which limits my preferences."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Veterinary Medicine, I am really enjoying my course and love living in such an awesome city :) Would recommend this university to everyone. My uni accommodation for first year is great as well.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Social Anthropology," I could never imagine studying anywhere else but at the University of Edinburgh. It offers a combination of an amazing city, great education and lovely people. The University of Edinburgh is one of the best universities in the world so having a degree from it is highly valued by employers. The course is incredibly interesting. The lecturers are all well-known figures in the field of anthropology. The university has two campuses - George square and King's Buildings. Both contain a library and Student union buildings. The Advice Place offers supports to students for a range of possible problems - accommodation, health, academic issues, etc. Moreover, each student is assigned a personal tutor, whom they can go to for advice on any enquiries they might have. I have only used the ones in the main campus - George Square - Pleasance, Potterrow and Teviot. Different kinds of events are organinsed daily in all three of them. I stayed in Pollock halls during my first year. The atmosphere is great. The RAs are friendly and welcoming and really try to make your first year a great experience. Edinburgh is an amazing city with lots of opportunities and things to do for all kinds of people.No matter if you prefer going to pubs, clubs or enjoying arts and culture - you can find a bit of everything in Edinburgh With more than 240 societies and clubs to choose from, there isn't any room for complaining."
rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Nursing Studies, I find courses quite fun. Meeting the patients and all the interesting parts of pathology.I would like to nominate Professor Tonks for the university Lecturer of the Year.
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics," I find it in general really good in all aspects: Academic level, Societies and other activities, and social life. Also the premises of the university are excellent and the support(academic and other) is very high. Course is good. Some Lecturers are exceptionally good, some disappointing. Nice place in the city, good distance from university/ city center"
rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Architecture," I have enjoyed my courses so far. They are challenging but interesting and the facilities all over the campus, including the college of art, are very good."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics," I have very little issue with the University. Well organised lectures and good societies. The clubs are terrible though, take Hive for an example."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," Great university, top of the range. Anyone studying here must be privileged to be at such a University. Great lecturers who explain the material thoroughly. All the uni facilities are brand new and top of the range. Excellent student support from older classes. The student union is a dream. Great food and drinks. Some accomodation is far out but overall its okay. City life is amazing, best you could ask for. There is a tremendous amount of clubs and societies to join."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat2,,rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Software Engineering, I like the university as a whole but the accomodations are way too expensive. The night life could be a bit developed but the opportunities which the university provides are priceless.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Spanish and Linguistics MA (Hons)," I LOVE IT HERE LOVE LOVE LOVE linguistics, it's my favourite thing ever! Amazing lecturers, fully involved tutorials, and really interesting topics. Maths (my outside course) is great, albeit very hard and HUGE. There's so much to learn! I get annoyed in the lectures however as nobody can keep quiet (not the uni's fault).Spanish is very difficult but enjoyable. For maths, it's great, there is mathsbase and mathspals which almost act as extra tutorials. The support is amazing.For linguistics and Spanish, this is less apparent, but there are regular revision sessions offered by the LangSoc for linguistics. Beautiful old building! Although they shouldn't have replaced the windows with the horrible new ones! #BringBackClassicWindows I wouldn't know as I'm in UNITE accommodation, but I arranged it through the uni and it's great. The clubs are better than at home, and it seems there's a society for everything!"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics," I love it here. Not sure! I have been told that it is top ten in the UK and you learn so much here. There are so many networking opportunities to get into if you join the right things! Quite variable from good to excellent. Great cafes and lecture theatres but can be quite expensive. Not really sure as I haven't needed to use it but the maths department were very understanding when I did need to hand in work early due to complicated circumstances. I don't spend much time there but it is good and cheap! I live in a great location, with all freshers which is perfect but of course it is still uni accommodation and its faults are down to us students really. Could do with a lift though! Love Edinburgh as a city, absolutely perfect combination (for me) of campus and city. So much to do and still there are opportunities to go to the highlands and see the country on day/weekend trips! You do have to seek some of them out yourself but they are there and well worth joining!"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA Geography," I love my uni and actually, it is the best place I can be! :)I met a lot of interesting students and academia with whom I share a lot of similar interests wihch is beneficial to my personal development. night clubs can be a little bit disappointing"
rat4,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Sociology and Politics MA (Hons)," I made lots of new friends here. Also. I learned a lot about society and the political world which I have found interesting. Most importantly,I have matured as a person for city/ further living. 40 for food"
rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences," I mean, it's fine. I wish I could say more - perhaps I'm just bitter about Oxbridge rejection, but really, there's something missing. Nobody really had this as there first choice - when you ask, everyone was rejected from somewhere, or couldn't afford where they actually wanted to go. That atmosphere makes it difficult to enjoy at times. There is also isolation at King's - you're so far away from the Central Campus, and few of the buildings have the beautiful facades the university seems to prostitute on every prospectus cover. Many science students feel cheated, and as a matter of fact, some humanities students do too - some buildings in George Square clash horribly with the other, historical buildings. I think I'll manage, but I don't know whether that's my work ethic or the university's name =. The broad range of subjects covered within modules, flexibility of degree, outstanding lecturers. They are very good; I'm situated in King's, and the library facilities are immense. We have """"personal tutors"""" but that's just Edinburgh trying to replicate Oxbridge and failing. One half-hour meeting (if you're incredibly lucky) at the beginning of a term hardly constitutes a tutorial system. The biology lecturers were very supportive with our first essay, which was great. I'm not sure what they do, really. I'm in catered, Holland House, and it is probably the only house that hasn't been done up. The pantries are grim, not really any area for socialising etc.. Wander. Loads, but I primarily attend ZooSoc, which is very active."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," I personally think studying in the university of Edinburgh is the best choice for me. I can improve my professional skills and enhance the capability of finding a promising career, also I live in the world's most famous tourist spot. The living conditions, combined with the academic atmosphere, will make the research process less exhausting and vivid. Though the course are sometimes intense and challenging, I can learn a lot from the lectures and coursework. Well-equipped facilities, gyms, libraries, cafes. etc. Somewhere can be very satisfying and cosy, somewhere is a little far form the campus. Brilliant city environment and public constructions. Various clubs and all kinds of societies that students can spend their leisure time on."
rat4,rat1,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics," I really enjoy the University.The lecturers are really professional and they prepare us for the exams really well. They are also tutorials, workshops and other sessions that additionally prepare you. I found really useful the sessions by other students as they have done the same exam a year ago and gave us a lot of useful ideas how to prepare well. The library in the university is amazing as it is the perfect place to study, provide us with lots of resources and works almost 24 hours a day."
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,International relations, I really like the university and I have made a lot of friends here. I would recommend the university to my friends back home.The facilities and student support are really good. And yeah.. fantastic!!I love the university!
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics and Software Engineering," I really like the University, both the courses and the social life as well.The university encourages the students to think about the current on going problems as well as of the future."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Theoretical Physics," I really love going to the University of Edinburgh, there is always stuff to do and lovely people to meet. My lecturers make the classes so much fun that I find myself looking forward to the next lecture Amazing teachers, the best ones I have ever had with out a doubt Never has any relation with them :) Very good, but I don't really enjoy the food Very international city, with lots of stuff to do EUCC Edinburgh university canoeing club is amazing, the people are great and the kayaking is so much fun!!!"
rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat2,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," I think that my University is one of the best in the world. There are a lot of prospectives for jobs, but I haven't had the chance to apply. The organisation of the courses is really good. As a player in the University team I really like the gym and all other facilities. The support so far has been good.I don't have any complaints. A good thing about the Union is being part of variety of organised events by the assosiation It's really expensive compared to renting a flat in the city Really beautiful and clean city with a lot of cultural history. I love it ! The societies have given me a chance to get to know a lot of people with my intrests."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Bsc (Hons) Computer Science and Mathematics, Great Uni
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Chinese Language, Great range of courses on offer. Great Facilities. The degree programme is very flexible. Lecturers are generally great. And the university is in my favourite city in the UK.

rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,BSc Mathematics," Great city. Fantastic facilities such as the library, computer access and gym. Brilliant societies available and a really nice student union in Teviot Row House. Only downside is the expense and in regards to courses the university uses it's research and international reputation to compensate for the lack of quality teaching and teaching time offered to undergraduates"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Geography," Good, good accomdation especially Chancellors!"

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Sport and Recreation Management BSc (Hons), good facilities good accommodation. Would recommend to anyone interested in social sciences or business. Also very good student life at the halls of residence.
rat3,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Politics and Sociology," General speaking, I feel good about our university. Though sometimes I feel a bit lost. Like a fish in a huge pool, there're so many people in the university and too many things going on. Some times people make mistakes when they choose clubs and societies, in which circumstance they will not feel connected to others."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat2,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics BSc (Hons)," First of all, the university improved my ability to learn by myself and still have help whenever I need it. The main problem for me is the university accommodation - it is just too expensive. Here I have met some of the best lecturers I have ever had and they know how to prepare us."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mechanical Engineering," Feedback on work is appalling, Needs more variety of lecturers to make thing interesting Uni seems to take this quite seriously Very average Great gym, nice library Haven't had much info on this Very active union Catered, but no facilities to cook with Great city, lots going on, perfect size Wide variety, well run, friendly"

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics, Excellent uni! This review has helped me realise how good it actually is.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat2,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics," Everything is amazing, the school is supportive and opens up many opportunities. Only difficult part is to find a part-time job as the competition for this is really high."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA History (Hons), Everyone should come to Edinburgh Uni
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics," Edinburgh University provide a good academics atmosphere and we can meet and know a lot smart students from overall the world. The Student Support is extremely useful which we can get help from lectures' office hours or help desk, some courses have peer support as well , such as Maths Pals and Economics Pals. We have a wide variety range of clubs and society that we can take part of and meet a lot of people from outside of course, which is very fascinating!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Japanese Studies," Edinburgh University is a fun university in terms of societies, but tends to not be as friendly as expected. Unless you attend halls or join societies in first year it is very hard to make friends in other subjects. I would recommend Edinburgh University (especially the Earth Sciences department which is amazing), but any student has to be extremely proactive as they do not receive any help with work. I cannot comment on this as I was never in university halls as a home student. There is a huge selection of amazing clubs and societies! Everything from kayaking to knitting to swing dance!"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA Psychology and Linguistics, Edinburgh uni so far has been great. The quality of teaching and materials have been awesome and I have really enjoyed my course and the university life and city. The societies have allowed me to make lots of friends as well and the city isn't too expensive if you budget.
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Informatics MInf," Great uni, great support for almost anything you'd ever need"
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematical Physics, Great overall experience. Made many friends and professors/tutors are easily approachable. Don't know yet. Courses relating to my major are good but I did not like how the professors in my outside course taught. Great library. N/A Joined the physics society. Great people Loud at night. Besides that it's fine. Great atmosphere Don't really participate.

rat3,rat3,rat3,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MPhys Physics," Good I have uncertainty about that Some lectures are going too fast to catch up Some of the university facilities are better than other Excellent I don't think I have use them yet Place Im living in is excellent! clean, modern and lively! I don't go to clubs and societies cos I don't have time"
rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics and Politics MA (Hons)," Excellent university with exceptional facilities and an international reputation. However, there is room for improvements in student support and basic teaching of lectures/tutorials One of the best universities for graduate employability, noted by an exceptional international reputation Great course but lectures not relevant enough Excellent facilities in IT and sport Great quality but often marred by long waiting times Great student union across all campuses of the university Great accommodation, if rather expensive Just a wonderful city for anyone of every possible interest/hobby Very diverse catalogue of clubs and societies, suited to any interest or passion"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat2,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Mathematics, Excellent Mixed opinions. Some courses and lecturers are great. Overall teaching is good. School of maths learning supervisor is exceptional! Very small room and not very social Excellent sports societies.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,English Literature and Language," Edinburgh University had become my new home, and has been such a welcoming experience, especially as I have come from an international background."
rat2,rat1,rat2,rat4,rat1,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Chemistry with Materials Chemistry," Disappointing for the rank 17 in the world. No idea Only a couple of decent lecturers. Most are pretty rubbish. Also, chemists have to do the engineering maths course most of which is totally irrelevant. Some leaky roofs and cafes are pretty lacking but overall pretty good. Almost non-existant Great building!Not much that I am interested in though I live at home I don't go out much I don't go out much.The Japanese society is awful though."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Edinburgh as a city is great and the university of Edinburgh is one of the best in the world and I am overwhelmed with joy to study here!
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Civil Engineering," Definitely a university that accepts only the best students from all over the world. High level of equality between international students and locals. Lots of opportunities to get help from the university concerning not only academic issues but financial and lifestyle as well. My overall rating of """"4"""" is due to the School of Engineering needing some further advancement in key areas such as tutorial teaching and practicals. However, it is worth to mention that throughout my 3 year studies in the university so far, the quality of teaching has increased substantially. People from industry seem to appreciate the UoE as an institution. Some are really good, others (most thought by lecturers teaching the course for the first year) are quite poor in communication with the students. Extremely good. All kinds of electronic appliances meant to help students throughout their academic life. Library most often than not extremely useful. Haven't really had the need to use their services, so can't tell. Expensive, but the newly built accommodation blocks are of really good quality and comfort. Extremely good air quality! Not too expensive, but ready-made food and nightlife (which is not really of interest in this case) is on the expensive side. City buildings are all really old, so you cannot expect much luxury from the student flats rented in the central area. Lots of clubs and great variety of them!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,MA Psychology," Definitely a world class university, but the whole experience feels structured around grades, rather than teaching. Having good grades is essential. Nonetheless, I do feel that the university experience here has provided me with some useful skills and knowledge too. Most of the lecturers are truly world class, and the courses engage us in interesting topics. The assessment criteria are awful, however, hence I'm giving it a """"4"""". The facilities are very well equipped. There's rarely something missing. Student support is helpful, but there's not that much they can do. The students' union is decent, but they are rather bureaucratic and excessively politically correct. Accommodation varies in quality. There tend to be lots of generic layouts, which can become annoying. Edinburgh is a very pleasant city apart from the gloomy weather. Edinburgh university is home to some excellent societies. Definitely one of the highlights of uni life."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,International Business with German MA (Hons), Could be more done in terms of genuinely feeling like student feedback is being used. Student halls could be a little bit more updated although the security in Robertsons Close is fantastic - as is the common room which I feel is underused. All in all I am incredibly glad I chose to come to Edinburgh.
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat2,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,International Relations, Decent uni
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Astrophysics, Course is really good and interesting. Student union buildings are awesome. Pollock Halls is a great environment and really social.

rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer science, Before coming here i didnt knew much about how the university was and how my course will be like but after coming here i dont regret about choosing University of Edinburgh as my university.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,French and Linguistics MA Hons (Undergraduate)," Beautiful city, very organised university, a wide variety of courses to choose from with a very active student life. City and university has lots to offer and cares about a student's social life as well as academic achievements. Overall, I am very happy to be here."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Chemistry, Any university you choose you'll like if you try! But still I would like to recommend this university. It is a great one and definitely worth trying.

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Computer Science," A wonderful university that offers amazing tutors, professors and facilities. Especially so for Computer Science - the courses are interesting and beneficial on a personal and professional basis. The students are on a high level as well. Engaging and interesting lecturers, that cater to every level of initial knowledge of the subject."
rat4,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics," A variety of courses are offered. We have so much options , which enable us to choose the courses that we are most into. Also, the campus is in the city center and that is quite convenient."
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,business management," A great uni overall! The fact that most of studying has to be done in your personal time is a bit upsetting, apart from that, fantastic!"
rat3,rat2,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences (Biochemistry) BSc (Hons)," A good, but not excellent university."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Sociology," Edinburgh is such an engaging, vibrant city to study in and the University of Edinburgh definitely reflects this. The school has so much to offer so many different kinds of people."

rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Intermedia Art," Edinburgh is a fantastic university for almost all courses. It's extremely accommodating to anybody who wants to find the balance between an active social life and a high quality of teaching. It has an edge over most universities in London because there's less of an oppressive big city feel, it's safer, slightly cheaper and more relaxing. The downside is that anyone living in self catered accommodation is missing out on the social atmosphere of Pollock halls where most first year students live."
rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Maths," Edinburgh is a dream and I love it- I would recommend the uni to everyone. Some are amazing and some are awful. Gym, JCMB and student unions and library are amazing. Accomodation was brilliant until we got mice from the flats around us. Theres so many societies to choose from- theres one for everyone and everyone is so friendly- its a great way to explore a new interest, make new friends and get more involved in uni life."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics, Edinbrugh is decent as it gets. Having to live in this city has its perks Sufficient Not always vocal Edinburgh is nice Diverse
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Economics, Economics lectures are really interesting. Staff here can always explain things clearly.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,English literture, Edinburgh is a really lovely city and the atmosphere at the uni is great. There are so many great societies and people are really friendly.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Linguistics," Despite some minor issues, overall I am happy with my education and life in Edinburgh Uni. Every semester there's at least one subject that's a total waste of time but overall I am satisfied with the quality of the course The one time I had to get some financial support, the Uni wasn't very helpful. Our union is OK but I've seen way better around Scotland. Some of the buildings are old and not well insulated. Others, however, are quite nice and comfy. The clubs are nothing like the ones back home and it's a bit expensive. I don't have much experience with these."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Politics, Edinburgh University has a fantastic staff in regards to lectures and tutorials. It has an excellent selection of internet resources that allow easy access for studying at home. There is a vast array of societies meaning you can even play if you are so inclined.
rat3,rat3,rat2,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Politics and Sociology," My university experience has been defined by involvement in societies. Edinburgh as a city is absolutely amazing, it feels safe and it is both cultural and fun. As an international student you end up paying a lot for money for every few contact hours for guidance. Having said that my dissertation supervisor was incredibly helpful and I enjoyed that aspect"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,International Relations," In my final year, I am currently loving my university experience. The course modules are much better now than in the 1st and 2nd year. My only advice is that be prepared to step up from school, be actively involved in societies. There is really something for everyone."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Sociology," There is a great atmosphere around the main George campus always. Everyone is very friendly and the nightlife is great. I would recommend not going through the uni for flats but instead going to private landlords, not only are the prices better but they are better location too"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Physics," University of Edinburgh is the best. Good facilities and student support. Lecturers are world class and interesting. Bars are good and there's an awesome mix of Oxbridge rejects and rich Americans which allows me to have free education. I would definitely recommend this uni, it has something for everyone."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Medicine, I have really enjoyed my time at the Uni so far. I lived in self-catered halls in first year and met some of my closest friends there. I would really recommend it. My course has been enjoyable so far although the communication and feedback from the department could be improved
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Landscape Architecture," Really enjoying my time here, I came up from South Wales and meeting new people and getting to know the city was really easy. Staff are helpful and recently I have been building my portfolio for an interview to which tutors are very helpful and guiding me to find a placement in the fourth year"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,Politics," I am loving my time at the University of Edinburgh. The classes are really good and I am really enjoying the student life, met some great people here. As an international student I felt very welcome. My most important piece of advice is that to know to organise your time and work"
rat3,rat2,rat3,rat4,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,05 Mar 15,International Relations," Student life is great, loads of free time so take the advantage of student union and clubs and societies. Courses could be better in many ways. Beware! The uni offers very little career advice though good for interview practice if you book in advance. Just make sure to take of yourself when it comes to careers and internships"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law," Fantastic university with excellent teaching and a vibrant student atmosphere. The School of Law is in the beautiful building of Old College and really does instill a sense of following in the footsteps of fantastic minds who have studied there before you. Edinburgh as a city is wonderful, and campus is set right in the middle of it, with easy access to the main attractions, nightlife and sports facilities."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Sustainable Development MA (Hons)," UoE is a top rate university and I am so grateful that I'm here. Excellent and knowledgeful lecturers (of course some better than others), great support from academic staff and great facilities. The city and the friendly atmosphere definitely is part of my love for this uni."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,MSc in Management, Excellent Uni !
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law LLB (Hons), It's a wonderful place to learn and Edinburgh is a gorgeous city. The university name is extremely useful for tracking down jobs after graduation as it is recognised as being a leader in the field. Generally very good. perfect :) lovely city to study in.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,law LLB, Can be very unorganised but great overall Excellent lecturers - Jose are involved in making the law or at least advise government Bit pricey but Potterow is great I was not in halls so don't know that well
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat2,,rat4,rat2,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,BUSINESS & ACCOUNTING," Overall good city to live in, the uni is good in terms of facilities and job prospects, but very, very average in terms of teaching and student support"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law, I find the experience at Edinburgh university to be amazing and I really enjoy both the academic and social side of things. My course is very well taught and there are a lot of social activities as well.
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,LLB," Overall, I am incredibly happy with having chosen Edinburgh. The university cares about its students more than any other university I am aware of, and the quality of teaching in my specific school is great. The city of Edinburgh is both beautiful and provides a perfect balance between the student community and local amenities."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Sustainable Development MA (Hons), over all really good experience so far

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Medicine, great uni
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,International Relations, Excellent university
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Architecture," the most beautiful university in scotland, and it deserves it's amazing reputation. seems to be incredibly employable great and informative, just slightly disorganised at times. ample study space and student union is amazing. never really needed to use it so i do not know. brilliant building, association and opportunities. Catered is great. amazingly cultured and vibrant city. too many to choose from."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law, enjoyed my time here and feel that the student support offered has been excellent - particularly with the careers advice given No experience of uni accommodation
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Economics," I feel that there is a huge jump from 2nd year to 3rd year, and it is not a positive change. However, this greatly varies from school to school- the Business School (where I was a student before), for example, is very organized and has a lot of funds. I wish I could say this of my own department. You need to watch out for yourself and do a lot of extracurricular stuff to be at the top of the list- but I imagine that this is the norm nowdays due to the demands of potential employers. unfortunately this varies greatly over departments and study years there are old and gloomy buildings from around the 70s (I'd say), but everything is being renovated. The new school of languages is fantastic, as is the extension of the David Hume Tower with underground facilities from last year. They have just refurbished an entire gym too with new, modern facilities. I can see that they are not sitting idle on a pile of money handed in by the students. Teviot is amazing as always, but I struggle to see what else the union does. Edinburgh is a beautiful touristic city, full of places to go, but this also means that prices can be high more than 200 societies to choose from. One needs to keep trying and will succeed in finding a place, as it happened to me."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,International Business with Spanish MA (Hons)," Edinburgh is a great city to study in and the university has an excellent reputation. However, there is a feeling that the university tend to rely heavily on their reputation and perhaps do not make as much effort with teaching standards and student support as other less prestigious universities. Not many opportunities for beginners taking up a sport. More often you have to already be playing a sport at a competitive level in order to continue with it at Edinburgh University."
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,rat3,,rat1,rat4,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,History MA (Hons), A great university run by an incompetent few. The general standard of teaching is lower than at many places around the UK but the city is so good to live in that there is a constant trade off between a worthwhile educational experience and a genuinely engaging and vibrant student life. Frequent strikes and often poorly organised. The online system is rudimentary compared to other universities whilst the lecturers are often not very good at using its most basic functions. Overall quite good although can sometimes be confusing. There are so many departments for things that personal tutors have no idea where you should go to enquire about certain issues. EUSA are notorious for being the most opinionated and pointless student union in the country. Often campaign against relatively trifling matters rather than suggesting any useful change. Their crusade against the male members of the university is infantile and misguided. one of the best places in the country to live as a student. Cheap accommodation and average living costs combined with a huge variety in things to do. I've spent three years here now and am still discovering amazing things I have never tried.
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,MA Archaeology," Excellent establishment if you work hard and take advantage of everything on offer. Between the many societies, academic and social, as well as the wide range of courses, Edinburgh caters quite broadly. However it is a moderately expensive city to live in which could be a problem. Same as any other university Lectures generally quite good but a lot of overlap between courses. Archaeology labs are very well equipped and there is always sufficient rooms for study/work. Quite limited Well equipped student union, occasionally difficult to book for functions and could be cheaper. Very average student halls Excellent city. So many societies and groups to choose from, world class brass band too."
rat3,rat2,rat2,rat2,rat1,,rat1,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Computer Science, Poor student support but overall great uni.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law," Very happy with everything at Edinburgh. The city, nightlife, library, union and facilities are second to none!"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law," The University is really great, It offers so much to home and visiting students. I have to say there is alot of support given to students, particularly from the disability team. The university accomodation is quite expensive in relation to the standard of rooms etc, however I no longer stay in residence and i think it has been recently inproved. The university would benefit from increased security around campus and cheaper food in the library cafe. But overall I love the University as it offers great education and great support to students."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Law LLB (Hons)," Job prospects, accommodation and quality of teaching all big pros."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Computer Science, Good Overall
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat1,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,27 Feb 15,Medicine, The Edinburgh University Student Association is a disgrace - it doesn't represent the views of students and exists solely to fill the CV's of the people in it.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Philosophy MA (Hons)," Amazing lecturers which have made for an enjoyable four years studying what I love!
The city in which the university is based makes attending Edinburgh University even easier!
The family environment in the schools which I have been a part of have been great!
Wide variety of clubs and societies, which I would have got involved in more if the course wasn't so heavy! Constant emails about future career prospects outside as well as inside the university best part of the university!
Altogether amazing! Quite expensive is its only downfall! Pollock Halls was a lovely environment in which to spend first year of university Best place to live!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,25 Feb 15,Geography with Environmental Studies MA (Hons)," Some lecturers seem as if lecturing shouldn't be part of their job, just not enough effort or thought.
However the vast majority of lecturers are enthusiastic, willing to help and nice people.
Also, there is a bit of an English, privately educated clique in Edinburgh university. Sounds a bit xenophobic, but it does have an impact on the way you feel in the university. Feel a bit belittled by such an overwhelming presence of wealthy, privately educated people.  Feel as if the increase in the number of universities and courses is devaluing an undergraduate degree. Whilst going to Edinburgh might increase my prospects comparatively to other universities, I feel as if the next 5 years is relatively bleak job-wise Libraries, gyms are great Lots of support when you need it for all different things Good cheap drinks and food. Loads of services Amazing city to live in"
rat3,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Psychology MA (Hons)," The university although good, does not offer much in the way of student support. It is hard to switch courses even if you have taken a subject as an outside, and people often are rejected from courses, what kind of university doesn't want their students to do as well as possible?"
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat2,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,International Relations MA (Hons)," Fantastic reputation, beautiful city...but very average teaching. Very little professor-student contact, minimal help from the university for post-grad plans.  Uni isn't too great at helping us get into the workforce. I've done all my work experiences with my own initiative Very average. Great, up to date tech in libraries, everything is online and smooth Could be better... Unfortunately highly politicized, they are generally not too respected by the student body.  Great halls Amazing city to be a student in Great variety"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Veterinary Medicine BVMS," Great city to be in, have loved all my 4 years spent here. Not enough students from the home nations. University has a good reputation which helps trying to find jobs. Most time spent at vet school which has up to date technology and excellent staff.  Prepares you well for jobs Could be better timetabling Very modern On offer but need confidence to search it out Weekly updates good Never had a problem Quite a small city but always fun Society for everything "
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Law LLB (Hons), Great university with great teaching. Amazing student experience and amazing city. I have met so many amazing people and have loved spending four years in Edinburgh.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,18 Feb 15,Economics and Politics MA (Hons)," Certainly world class in both its research and its teaching, something that is reflected in your everyday student life. A truly inspiring university located in the historic city centre of Edinburgh. "
rat1,rat3,rat1,rat1,rat1,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat1,Student Reviewer,05 Feb 15,Business Management MA (Hons)," The University does not live up to is prestige name! The large number of students you would think would make it easy to make friends but it is the complete polar opposite, if you made it there off of your own back by obtaining good grades rather than Mummy and Daddy paying for you to be there you are the outsider and made aware of this constantly. It is full of public school students and foreign students meaning Scottish students feel like they are on an exchange. The standard of teaching is extremel poor and it is as if lecturers get in and out of the lecture as quickly as possible even if this means missing out part of the course that they have not been able to cover in the designated time period. Feedback is nonexistant and very little help or guidance is provided. In the four years i spent at this university i felt that instead of improving i was taking steps backwards. Not only this but the whole environment and feel of the university is distant from the City in which it inhabits so if you are drawn to the neauty of Edinburgh, the uinversity could not be more distant from this. In my four years it never made me realise who i was as a person, rather it destroyed me as a person, causing me depression which was then even more poorly helped by the university as the councilling sesions on offer were in the middle of the library meaning there was no confidentiality and a maximum of 6 sessions was allowed with no more after."
rat1,rat1,rat1,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat1,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Feb 15,Music BMus (Hons), Unemployable and didn't enjoy my learning or student experience. I wouldn't recommend coz there are too many yahs and you don't get a very good education. I wouldn't bother with this place since everyone is so stuck up.  Too expensive
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,21 Jan 15,International Relations and International Law MA (Hons)," I`m not a student in it, because I`m not still at this age, but I give my vote for University of Edinburgh, because I dream of its perfection...and what better reason?"
rat2,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Nov 14,Scottish History MA (Hons)," Ok, but hugely overrated. I often felt as if the only reason I was there was to make money for the university. Some lecturers should never have been put in front of a class in the first place. Degrees from Edinburgh still carry some clout. Goodness knows how.  Throughout my time, I spent very little time on campus outside lectures and tutorials. The trip to the library was like entering death row, with hundreds of glum students jammed in between shelves of countless books. 
Despite this, most of them appeared to be watching Funny Cat Compilation Videos their equally miserable friends had sent them on BookFace. I recall when on a number of occasions, I would be in a desperate rush to print an essay or assignment, only to be prevented from doing so by a YouTube-addicted first year, taking a well-deserved break from his course on Semantic Externalism, by watching 'My Chihuahua Being a Chihuahua' or some similarly pointless drivel on the university computers.  Couldn't support a single American, never mind 10000 of them. But who can, really?  Good nachos.  Edinburgh's a good city to live in. Better than Glasgow.  Mostly run by ex-public schoolboys, dressed in tweed. No patience for those guys. "
rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,10 Nov 14,Mathematics BSc (Hons)," Edinburgh is a beautiful city and with a combined good student union, it makes way as a really fun place to study. There is so much to do here that you'll feel you won't have enough time to get through it all.
However, I didn't enjoy my course because it lacked what I came for which was Maths. In the first two years, you take many outside courses which is a benefit to most however I wanted to concentrate and learn about my subject. I made the mistake of coming to Edinburgh (coming from England) not knowing that their four year courses included many outside courses. This meant that I was not learning my course, Maths like I wanted to. The lectures themselves: in first year, lectures include clickers which allows students to communicate to one another when a question appears. The downside is that it takes up a lot of time hence, the depth of content isn't covered like it should be and I felt I wasn't learning as much as could do. 
The course at Edinburgh is the one reason why I wouldn't continue at this university hence the bad rating. Another reason is that many of the students didn't choose maths as their main course thus it was hard to meet people on my course with a general interest for it. 
If you can pick a subject that you do like here then you'll find you'll enjoy the rest of the university easily. Library is fantastic. Although it does get packed easily. However, the facilities are great and there's a good student vibe. George Square is where you feel the student vibe. Students everywhere walking about gives it the campus feeling that you wouldn't think it had because it is in the centre of the city.
A massive gym complex (CSE) nearby which is £106 a year. For great prices, the gym offers so much in terms of equipment. With a separate room for everything you really do feel you're getting your monies worth. 
There is a Blackwell's bookshop 5 minutes away from George Square which is handy for textbooks at lower prices. For maths, there is an online website where students asks for advice which is really good because all students can look at these. There is also a group called Maths Pals which allows students to go and ask for advice about anything. A lot of help is given on this that it is unfortunate the system for mathematics lectures were not the same. There are two main spots for the union, Potterow and Teviot. The latter is a Hogwarts like building that is upbeat inside. You really feel the student vibe when you're here. Potterow is where the night events happen however for such a big university, the facilities are quite small on a busy night.
For a night out, there are plenty of clubs (relatively small) yet enjoyable as well as pubs . The main residential hub is Pollock Halls. 2000 students live in this catered area and it is a great place to meet people. It's even worth the extra walk. 
I stayed in private accommodation (Chalmers Street) and apart for the price, all facilities were amazing. Double bed and massive kitchen is a big bonus for self catered. The only issue was that many of the people here were not from Edinburgh University hence it was difficult to mix in with my university. My advice is that if you would like an easy in for the social life, then go to Pollock Halls It's breathtaking when you get here and walk through the streets with all the cultural buildings. There's a castle in the middle of the city! The Prince's street area is great for shopping and the Scottish atmosphere all year round is great. There is much to do and walking up Arthur's seat (extinct volcano) gives you an thrilling view of Edinburgh.
Usually you'll have too much to do thus, it's hard to get all the fun city stuff in.  Clubs are great. In the cricket club there are many social events as well as training. Edinburgh are known for winning many club sport. The table tennis club and tennis club are run quite well and there are many new sports like Ultimate frisbee and Shinty that you can try out. 
The societies tend to die down after Freshers however in the ever cool sounding Maths society, events such as pub quizzes and pub golf are only a handful of events that go on. Societies tend to do families nights so that all years are brought together. "
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, The best time of my life. University has completely changed my life after I separated from my parents and it's awsome! A lot of things to do and responsibility tho. I think the best part of uni is becoming independent so if you want this you are gonna have a great time.
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Pollock Halls, the student accomodation is grreat! So many people, clubs, sport. Never get boring here.

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Informatics MSc," Cool Uni. I am enjoying the IT labs, they are quite reliable and reasonably modern. I think my course is pretty cool and so far I am enjoying halls! Found a lot of cool guys to share my interests, don't have to go solo queue anymore ;)"

Student Union is far away, but averagely good. Study what you like and university will be fantastic. People here, are from everywhere, good to socialize and live with them. "
rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,,,rat3,rat1,rat1,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Sociology and Social Anthropology MA (Hons), Up to moment I honestly don't feel like doing something here.The only thing that is kind of entertaining is spending time in the student's union.
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History and Politics MA (Hons)," I like it so far, however, I'm thinking about changing the accommodation as I don't like it.The city is beautiful, but people aren't that attractive."

There are so many students all the time and most of them are just plain stupid, walking around like they are lost or something. If you come to university, make sure you live in a Nrmal flat out of halls with Nrmal people."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Business Studies and Law MA (Hons), So glad I chose to come all the way from America to Edinburgh Uni!

I like the town but there is quite a lot to do so I don't often get the opportunity to go out. I'd say the best thing to do before you decide coming to uni is picking a course you are really interested in and the best place to do it at. "
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Easy to make friends around the student halls. Very social place, however Edinburgh has an averagly cold weather.

rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Veterinary Medicine BVMS," Most of the letrures are useless, and needs improvement in terms of work structures. Student union is poor, and badly organized. Edinburgh is a great place for university, and really makes the uni experience unique. Good grades needed for University of Edinburgh, and it is pretty challanging to get into thrugh application. Motivation is needed, and interst towards the course is important. Great place to recommend, chose your degree carefully. Apply in time. "
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Neurobiology MPhil, We have a lot to study. I spent much time each day in the library and extra hours on my room studying and as I kNw from other people the study even more. The lectures are Nt very good because the don’t explain us everything but I generally like uni because i live alone without my parents and Nw i have all the responsibilities for my own life. Great Uni experience.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Business Studies and Law MA (Hons)," Very good univeristy, I can only recommend it. The clubs and societies are vast, try to join as many as possible next to your studies. By joining societies you will belong to groups, and will make your time in Edinburgh much nicer.

I guess it depends on the type of person but for me halls is Nt as fun since I don't like getting wasted every night. If you are coming to uni and halls you should make sure you are up to sacrifice some sleep, and work does Nt come easy with it. I wish I had better flatmates."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,,"  Courses are challanging, it is the best place to be in Scotland. Lots of opportunity for exhchange programms.

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, The uni is quite satisfactory. I wouldn't say it is the greatest university but it does stand up to it's name. This is my final year here and I am looking forward to going out in the real world and getting a real job.

My course so far has Nt been meeting my expectations and I was honestly expecting a lot more from the social part of the Uni as well.

Course could be better, but it is a great uni experience. City, Edinburgh could be better, but student hall is perfect to socialize and meet with other students.

I think the accomodation on campus is a really great way to meet new people. I am Nt as happy as I could be with my course but it is Nt too bad. The thing I really like is the awsome Bulgarian Society! There are so many bulgarians I kNw from before I feel like I'm home! Also there is N chalga music!

I would have expected maybe a wider variety of females, but a good Sherry never fails to ensure my good time. Anybody considering university should keep in mind, it ain't N walk in the park for the lazy, on the other hand I am Nt finding my own course challenging eNugh. "

The course I'm doing is pretty high standard, I was kind of struggling the first semester but it's all good, just have to study a lot. I was kind of expecting the societies to be a bit more active, so far its Nt been really interesting, but i found some nice friends so I'm good :)"

rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Univeristy of Edinburgh offers a good double major opportunity. I chose literature and art history as it fits together in many aspect. I like art history more, as it is really fascinating to learn about a course with directly reflects in the city. Edinburgh is old and modern at the same time, full of history, and art. City life is great, and Love Edinburgh how busy it is every day. "

I am Nt used to the system of studying and I don't kNw what to do with the exams coming up.. very hard work!"

My placement is really great as well, I think I am getting on really well with the staff of the hospital and I might even consider it as a real job perspective when I graduate."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Chinese and French MA (Hons)," Uni is alright, I like that I was able to find a really good payed job with their help. I am also pretty happy with my course besides the part that I am really busy. If you are coming here and you need to support youself throughout your studies you should kNw that it is hard. I think that putting in hard work is really rewarding tho. Good luck!"

Other than the nightlife, there are plenty of other things to do in this beautiful city. the sports through the university were great."

Even if drinking isnt your thing there is plenty to get up to in the capital."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Veterinary Medicine BVMS," I have been at both St Andrews and Edinburgh university, both institutions are excellent and I have really enjoyed my time here. I definitely would recommend both of them and I am very glad that I studied with them."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,28 Jan 14,Environment and Development MSc," To me, Edinburgh Uni is a classic university that is big, traditional and very diverse. You could find any kind of people and research there, simply because of its size.
The size means that many administrative processes are very slow and inefficient, but not as bad as to seriously affect your study experience. For example, they switched only recently to a new e-mail provider to replace the previous outdated e-mail provider (a change that had been done at my previous university, a small campus university, many years before). Generally, IT services are not very good. For example, staff and PhD student pages are seriously outdated and the university even recommends PhD students to create homepages on external blogging sites because the university is unable to provide its own platform.
The courses are generally of good quality, but not outstanding. At Edinburgh Uni, lecturers are completely normal people who do solid work. Most of them are very much under pressure to produce research output to maintain the high position in rankings which sometimes affects quality of teaching. 
Student accommodation at Edinburgh Uni is basically a scam. Rooms are much more expensive than on the private market and are mostly taken by rich (Chinese) students from overseas. I think this is the weakest point of the university. There is a lot of networking potential lost in making student accommodation accessible only to the rich.
The other weak point of the university are the high tuition fees, especially for overseas students. Basically, you only get either very rich people or people with scholarships.
Overall, it's the best university in Scotland and one of the best in the UK. Very well respected, but you won't appear overqualified (as might be a problem e.g. with an Oxbridge degree)."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat1,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,07 Dec 13,Biological Sciences BSc (Hons)," First off, Edinburgh is a fantastic place to live and study in. This University will open many doors for you in the future, particularly if you're studying science/medicine etc (I'm studying BSc Biological Sciences (Hons)). If you're also aspiring to do biology here, the course in the first semester isn't especially great but only because its very general as they're trying to show you all aspects of biology in order for you to accurately pick your honours with regards to your interests. The lecturer's/practical leaders are in general very good however it is a totally different way of learning from school so be prepared. There were a couple of particularly bad lecturer's but they change a lot so you're not going to have a bad one for long. The lecturer's who covered the difficult parts of the course were all fantastic. The accommodation however is DISGUSTING and is the only thing I'm not enjoying so far about being here. I stay in self-catered South Clerk Street and it really is horrible (mice, flies, constantly have no hot water, smell of dampness, bad kitchen appliances, bad furnishings in rooms, the list goes on...). However this is the most cheap accommodation and I have been in the nicer self-catered flats which seem very nice to live in and people who live there enjoy it so my advice is to steer clear of the University cheap self-catered flats. One huge good point though is that you meet so many really lovely people staying in halls, so I would recommend it, just not South Clerk Street! Pollock I have never been to however I've heard the food isn't all that great so it's a waste of money to go catered. Overall, I would recommend Edinburgh as it is the highest ranked Uni in Scotland(just now) and you will go places with a degree from here. "
