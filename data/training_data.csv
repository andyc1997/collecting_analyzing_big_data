The contact I have with my supervisor is very good, and other members of academic staff are usually very receptive and responsive to emails The facilities, both in terms of outfitting and breadth of choice, are second to none.

This year being my dissertation year, with more emphasis on self-study and research instead of lots of contact hours with tutors, made it so that I didn't feel the impact as much as I might have in a different course. My supervisors this year have been excellent, so even though I didn't have a lot of contact hours, each tutorial session I had with them allowed me to hone my research further and further. If you know what you want out of the course and what area you want to go into going forward, this is a really great course. The freedom in the range of topics you can pick for your papers really allows you to tailor the course to your specific needs. That being said, if you don't know, it might be better to choose a course with a more specific scope. I knew what I wanted to study and my future goals going into the course, and so I got a lot out of exploring theology from the lens of that area, but for someone with a less clear vision it may be harder to do that. Lectures can be hit or miss depending on if they are relevant to what you are studying, but it's worth it to listen to see if there are any interesting ideas you can write about in your paper. The most important people are the supervisors for your papers.

1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Student Reviewer,06 Nov 16,Oriental Studies MSt," Overall university experience was frankly dreadful, I used to lock myself in my room and just cry on the floor at least once a week because I felt so overwhelmed with the work. The essays I slaved over often weren't handed back to me on time in order to look at the feedback before writing another one. It was dire. See other sections for my further comments. Careers department only geared up for law, finance and the like. No knowledge of creative areas. NOTHING. STAY AWAY. At this point I would like to point out that I studied Oriental Studies Japanese at Oxford (BA) but WhatUni doesn't list this course so I have to leave a review for the MSt (sorry). 
Some lecturers were fine, but unfortunately the organisation of the Oriental Institute was so terrible that I felt it greatly disadvantaged the students on the course. Such as:
- Course options listed in the prospectus were suddenly made unavailable in the term before specialisation, meaning that students who had wanted to study, for example, Japanese theatre or sociology, now had to choose between linguistics, literature or politics. Although the lecturers had sufficient time to warn us of this, they refused to respond to our requests, and in fact shouted at the students who enquired above the departmental lecturers, as though it wasn't a reasonable request to want to know which options would be available!
- In the second year, students were required to attend daily lectures at the Chinese institute, which were provided for the benefit of Sinologist students. The course content was not relevant to the Japanese exam contents. One wonders why the students were thus required to attend.
- Course was changed for the lower years meaning the new students had to try to learn modern and classical Japanese in the same year, which of course was impossible. Imagine trying to teach Shakespeare to a Japanese high schooler learning to say 'hello' - you just wouldn't do it. But the Oxford Oriental Institute would!
- Grades for the annual exams were publicly circulated by the lecturers amongst the students. 
- No pastoral support during the year abroad. Not even to help students find a placement before they left. No guidebook. No advice as to our student status during that year, which led to some students' final year funding being cancelled. 
- Not all the material was covered before the final exams. Lecturers not bothered, although 
- Contents of the final exams changed three weeks prior to final exams.
- Final exam format being significantly different to what we had been told (ie 'In this exam you will not be required to read' and then having a reading section). 
- As far as the famous Oxford tutorial system of one-on-ones with your lecturers, this did not exist for the Oriental Studies Japanese course. Our tutorials in final year were with a group of five students and one lecturer. That is a seminar, not an Oxford tutorial.
- No official 'head of course' or person who would respond to our enquiries, doubts or concerns. 
All in all, I could not have had a more disappointing experience at Oxford. I hear the Chinese Institute is much more organised, so perhaps that course would be worth considering in place of this one. I could recommend the Japanese course to wealthy students with nerves of steel, who require four hours sleep a night and no social life, who enjoy linguistics, history and classical Japanese. If you are remotely interested in sociology or any humanities aspect, pick any other course. Honestly at the end I was broken and totally disillusioned with Oxford. 0/10. Excellent librairies Tutors can be utterly awful and the 'moral tutors' who are responsible for your welfare appear to have no training in this area or even a smidgen of common sense ('Depression? But you look very well.') 
The counselling service was much better, highly recommended. Good, with a visible presence Expensive Alright if you don't mind the lack of activities or social diversity Not impressed with the ball system, which effectively acts as a social filter (some ball tickets 200 quid a pop, good luck with trying to attend your college party if you're from a low-income background).",Overall university experience frankly dreadful use lock room cry floor least week felt overwhelmed work essay slave often n't hand back time order look feedback write dire See section comment Careers department gear law finance like knowledge creative area NOTHING STAY AWAY point like point study Oriental Studies Japanese Oxford BA WhatUni n't list course leave review MSt sorry lecturer fine unfortunately organisation Oriental Institute terrible felt greatly disadvantage student course Such Course option list prospectus suddenly make unavailable term specialisation mean student want study example Japanese theatre sociology choose linguistics literature politics lecturer sufficient time warn refuse respond request fact shout student enquire departmental lecturer n't reasonable request want know option available second year student require attend daily lecture Chinese institute provide benefit Sinologist student course content relevant Japanese exam content student thus require attend Course change low year mean new student try learn modern classical Japanese year course impossible Imagine try teach Shakespeare Japanese high schooler learn say 'hello n't Oxford Oriental Institute Grades annual exam publicly circulate lecturer amongst student pastoral support year abroad Not even help student find placement leave guidebook advice student status year lead student final year funding cancel Not material cover final exam Lecturers bother Contents final exam change week prior final exam Final exam format significantly different tell ie exam require read reading section As far famous Oxford tutorial system one-on-ones lecturer exist Oriental Studies Japanese course tutorial final year group student lecturer seminar Oxford tutorial official 'head course person respond enquiry doubt concern disappointing experience Oxford hear Chinese Institute much organised perhaps course worth consider place one recommend Japanese course wealthy student nerve steel require hour sleep night social life enjoy linguistics history classical Japanese remotely interested sociology humanity aspect pick course Honestly end break totally disillusion Oxford Excellent librairies Tutors utterly awful 'moral tutor responsible welfare appear training area even smidgen common sense 'Depression look well counsel service much good highly recommend Good visible presence Expensive Alright n't mind lack activity social diversity Not impress ball system effectively act social filter ball ticket quid pop good luck try attend college party 're low-income background,oxford

It has caused my curiosity for science to grow and we have covered a large range of topics, many of which were informative and interesting. There are many enthusiastic lecturers who make learning fun.

I look forward to a more conventional university experience in years to come and am excited to learn more about biomedical science. We have been contacted regularly by the careers service and hopefully this is something that will be easier to be involved in once in-person sessions can resume. We had a couple of guest speakers and interesting debates that were outwith the course requirements but related to the current science world. 3 Although I only lived in halls for 3 months, I had a positive experience. The room I was assigned to was spacious and had all the furniture I needed. The communal kitchen was on the small side for 5 people and we ran into some difficulties as we only had one small fridge freezer between us and no couch, so any socialising had to be done around the kitchen table. The cleaning service was good and if we needed repairs in the flat, someone would be sent quickly. The tutorial groups were great as they allowed us to create a bond with the tutor, which was nice as we had no in-person teaching. Some course organisers were better than others at providing mental health support, although on a university level I am unsure of the services available to me.

It has caused my curiosity for science to grow and we have covered a large range of topics, many of which were informative and interesting. There are many enthusiastic lecturers who make learning fun. I have become good friends with my flatmates and also managed to meet a few people from my course too through group work and personal tutor. I look forward to a more conventional university experience in years to come and am excited to learn more about biomedical science. We have been contacted regularly by the careers service and hopefully this is something that will be easier to be involved in once in-person sessions can resume. We had a couple of guest speakers and interesting debates that were outwith the course requirements but related to the current science world. 3 Although I only lived in halls for 3 months, I had a positive experience. The room I was assigned to was spacious and had all the furniture I needed. The communal kitchen was on the small side for 5 people and we ran into some difficulties as we only had one small fridge freezer between us and no couch, so any socialising had to be done around the kitchen table. The cleaning service was good and if we needed repairs in the flat, someone would be sent quickly. The tutorial groups were great as they allowed us to create a bond with the tutor, which was nice as we had no in-person teaching. Some course organisers were better than others at providing mental health support, although on a university level I am unsure of the services available to me. I think this is something that could be advertised more within the university as it could help more people if it was made more accessible. I can't comment on the disability support as this does not apply to me.

There were major issues with accessibility to teaching due to poor broadband in halls and with isolation policies (leading to the Sports Union stepping in to deliver meals). Whilst these issues were mostly resolved in Semester 2, we were promised a hybrid learning model, which has still failed to materialise. I would not have moved to Edinburgh if I had known the university would provide the year it has. 4 All University of Edinburgh facilities (social and academic) are clean and easily accessible and are of good quality.

The University itself I could not recommend on any front. If you can choose to go somewhere else I would suggest you do. The careers service are pretty good at trying to create opportunities through seminars and one-on-one meetings. 3 The library is murder trying to get a seat, and lecture theatres are camped and out dated. The support is shocking and any complaints raised are batted away if they are even responded to at all. If you are looking for a hands off University this is the perfect one. However, as soon as you have a query or a worry about anything from academic marks to mental health, the University does not want to know you. Same as the University itself, the SU purports to help but no change is ever actually brought about. The flats in Edinburgh are beautiful, but the hunt for one is difficult as landlords and letting agents with pit students against each other to raise prices.

I had mentors living in Midlothian who were commuting all the way to West Lothian. They were teaching a subject in high demand but could not find a job within reasonable commuting distance. One of them needed to drive 140 min every day. Additionally, if your subject is quite niche (Modern Foreign Languages, Music, Latin, even Physics), you may be the one person who does not get a placement. I was stuck home twice and missed out on 3 weeks of placements (of 12 in total!) because the university could not organise a placement for me. Additionally, the university does not provide support when bullying in schools takes place. Mentors can be harsh and are not monitored at all. Racism in school is often ignored by the mentors. Placements are planned by the university, but some subjects (especially mine) were struggling to find placements. The potential issues and prospects for future employment were not communicated during the initial interview. Please do your research before you accept a place. The market for teachers is not as bright as the university makes it out to be. Be prepared to commute up to 180 min per day and accept that you may have to move once your studies are finished. 12 Very outdated, buildings from the 70s.

If you send an outline to her, she just says its fine and give you a bad grade. Do not trust tutors. Your outlines must have problems and no note on outline means you need to chase them for more advice, which they may or may not give.

5.0,,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,,5.0,3.0,Patrick,08 Jun 18,Philosophy MA (Hons)," On applying to Edinburgh I was aware of some of the poor satisfaction ratings, but didn’t think much of them given the reputation of the University. I have always loved the city and all seemed perfect on paper, so didn’t think twice about going. However, having now left before the end and largely wasted a few years I seriously wish I had.
I was straight A’s at A level but never really felt at all like my feet were on the ground here academically, and rarely felt engaged or stimulated by my course. Many people do well here and obviously much of this falls on me, but I definitely feel I could have done much better elsewhere. Likewise, the university administration is cold, unhelpful and impersonal, at times inept. Cant ever remember feeling like I was being supported, and if you want any assistance you have to actively hound down the staff. The only real ‘contact’ you have with the uni is through your tutor, who (while I’m sure excellent as an academic) just wasn’t qualified to give any useful guidance, just repeating generic advice you could find in the prospectus, and the uni clearly cares way more about its reputation than its students.
Then there is the culture of the campus, which i found to be this weird mix of ‘rah’ rich kids and Student Union PC culture you more associate with american uni’s, which i found impossible to navigate. It’s a very big uni and different people will have different experiences, but I remember feeling very isolated and frustrated a lot of the time here, as well as unhappy. Dont want to necessarily recommend against going because some people have a fantastic experience and I definitely had some bad luck in my time here with regards to the people I found myself in, but I would suggest taking the bad reviews seriously. Never Used 12 generally very good My tutor was next to useless, and he was the only contact I had with the university. Simply wasn't qualified to give any useful advice, and normally just directed me to someone else. politically correct nightmare. edinburgh is a great city Some were fine, though I was never bowled away by organisation. Tennis was good if you made one of the three teams (so 20 people in a uni of 20,000) and i narrowly missed out, otherwise poor.",apply Edinburgh aware poor satisfaction rating ’ think much give reputation University always love city seem perfect paper ’ think twice go However leave end largely waste year seriously wish straight A ’ A level never really felt foot ground academically rarely felt engage stimulate course Many people well obviously much fall definitely feel do much well elsewhere Likewise university administration cold unhelpful impersonal time inept Cant ever remember feel support want assistance actively hound staff real ‘ contact uni tutor ’ sure excellent academic ’ qualify give useful guidance repeat generic advice find prospectus uni clearly care way reputation student Then culture campus find weird mix ‘ rah ’ rich kid Student Union PC culture associate american uni ’ find impossible navigate ’ big uni different people different experience remember feel isolated frustrate lot time well unhappy Dont want necessarily recommend go people fantastic experience definitely bad luck time regard people find suggest take bad review seriously Never Used generally good My tutor next useless contact university Simply n't qualify give useful advice normally direct someone else politically correct nightmare edinburgh great city fine never bowl away organisation Tennis good make team people uni narrowly miss otherwise poor,edinburgh

1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,Student Reviewer,15 Jun 17,Philosophy MA (Hons)," I'm going to graduate next month and, if I'm being honest, I really regret coming to Edinburgh. I've met some really great friends and been taught by some incredibly clever and inspiring lecturers but, on balance, these people are in the minority. I'm a Scottish student, so I'm lucky enough to not pay tuition fees, but I've still gained £20,000 worth of living cost debt and spent 4 years of my life fighting the inept university administration at every turn.
The vague marking schemes and inability to appeal grades on the basis of ""academic difference of opinion"" makes it very difficult to succeed here. The lack of support for mentally ill and disabled students is a further obstacle which the university repeatedly refuses to address. Sexism is pretty rampant in many subjects, with only 4 female lecturers in my whole degree department, and many courses having a reading list without a single female author. 
During my time, I've seen my fellow students act in fairly disgusting ways, and the University administration has either ignored it because they didn't care, or because a lot of these students were rich. I've heard students talk in tutorials about killing disabled children, enslaving the poor, and remain unchallenged by lecturers under the pretence of these classes being an ""open environment for ideas"". I've heard stories from my friends about racially ignorant comments in their classes being overlooked, and have witnessed similar comments in my own classes.
Honestly, if you've gotten into any other universities that you've applied for, I'd just go there instead. This should be your last resort. I get near constant emails from the careers department, but they're mostly for jobs in finance, management, or other generic areas not linked to my degree. The summer schools, go abroad courses, and unpaid internships are only really viable choices if you're rich enough to not have to work in the summer to pay rent. It's very inconsistent, but some of my lecturers are really passionate about their subject and genuinely take an interest in your learning. Some of my classes are pretty overcrowded, so 1-on-1 time is pretty limited, but I think some of my lecturers would spend extra time with us if they had the time. Pretty good. The buildings are kept quite well, though the construction work at McEwan Hall ran over its deadline by an entire year. Humanities courses are, in general, marked very inconsistently. My marks have depended on the personal opinions of lecturers a lot, and I've found that the best way to get good marks is just, through trial-and-error, to find a lecturer who likes your writing style. The essay and midterm feedback is minimal to say the least. In my second year, I got an essay handed back to me and the marker had just highlighted an entire paragraph and written ""No"" next to it. This was one of 3 total comments on a 1500 word essay that I had spent 4 days writing. From talking to friends in my courses, they've had similar experiences.
Personal support is pretty awful too. My friends with mental health issues (such as anxiety and depression) have had little to no support. There's a 10 week minimum wait for counselling from the University Student Services. I have a mild learning disability and my requests for altered assessment methods in some courses were ignored. The union is pretty badly organised in my opinion. Every year, the union runs elections for various positions, but none of these positions actually come with the power to change anything because they don't have a separate or ringfenced budget. The societies are organised by the SU a lot, but the political ones (e.g. political party societies, action for Palestine, feminist society) have messy elections where you can easily get away with voting as an unregistered member or voting twice. There's also been issues during my time at University with misogynistic fraternities who would make semi-serious plans about raping female students. My flatmates and I have found bugs in the carpet since we first started living here and the landlords have just told us to ""clean more"" even though we are a very clean flat. The rent + bills are so high that I have less than £50 left of my student loan per month to live on. If I didn't have a part time job then I don't know how I could afford to live here. Relative to where some of my classmates live, this is a cheaper area. Edinburgh is a beautiful city with a rich culture and heritage. There's a decent selection of clubs, bars, restaurants, and cultural sites such as the museums, galleries, or monuments. This is one of the best things about being a student in Edinburgh. A decent selection, though some of them require memberships to be purchased before you can try them out. As I mentioned while talking about the student union, there's a lot of issues about how the societies are run. If you have a job, it's pretty hard to go to any societies just because they can be quite time-consuming (especially sports societies).",'m go graduate next month 'm honest really regret come Edinburgh 've meet really great friend teach incredibly clever inspiring lecturer balance people minority 'm Scottish student 'm lucky enough pay tuition fee 've still gain worth living cost debt spent year life fight inept university administration turn vague marking scheme inability appeal grade basis academic difference opinion make difficult succeed lack support mentally ill disabled student obstacle university repeatedly refuse address Sexism pretty rampant many subject female lecturer whole degree department many course reading list single female author time 've see fellow student act fairly disgust way University administration either ignore n't care lot student rich 've hear student talk tutorial kill disabled child enslave poor remain unchallenged lecturer pretence class open environment idea 've hear story friend racially ignorant comment class overlook witness similar comment class Honestly 've get university 've apply go instead last resort get near constant email career department 're mostly job finance management generic area link degree summer school go abroad course unpaid internship really viable choice 're rich enough work summer pay rent 's inconsistent lecturer really passionate subject genuinely take interest learning class pretty overcrowd 1-on-1 time pretty limited think lecturer spend extra time time Pretty good building keep quite well construction work McEwan Hall run deadline entire year Humanities course general marked inconsistently mark depend personal opinion lecturer lot 've find best way get good mark trial-and-error find lecturer like writing style essay midterm feedback minimal say least second year get essay hand back marker highlight entire paragraph write next total comment word essay spend day write talk friend course 've similar experience Personal support pretty awful friend mental health issue anxiety depression little support 's week minimum wait counsel University Student Services mild learning disability request altered assessment method course ignore union pretty badly organise opinion year union run election various position none position actually come power change anything n't separate ringfenced budget society organise SU lot political one e.g political party society action Palestine feminist society messy election easily get away voting unregistered member voting twice 's also issue time University misogynistic fraternity make semi-serious plan rap female student flatmate find bug carpet first start live landlord tell clean even clean flat rent + bill high less £50 left student loan month live n't part time job n't know afford live Relative classmate live cheap area Edinburgh beautiful city rich culture heritage 's decent selection club bar restaurant cultural site museum gallery monument best thing student Edinburgh decent selection require membership purchase try mention talk student union 's lot issue society run job 's pretty hard go society quite time-consuming especially sport society,edinburgh
5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,Student Reviewer,25 Feb 17,Photography BA (Hons)," Overall, I've enjoyed it but have encountered a few difficulties which the uni was very supportive with and ultimately helped sort instantly. I've had a good experience so far and find it a very homely place to live. Always seem to be careers advice emails sent around - I've yet to attend one of these sessions and we have a few careers festivals catered to certain subjects. For example there's a creative careers festival soon where I've signed up for an awful lot of workshops. Lecturers are very passionate about both their work and others. Brilliant facilities and we have a new department opening soon which will open up more opportunities. The best out of the art schools I applied to regarding facilities - especially with the new department opening in late 2017. Overall, in the University the libraries and other facilities are very good. Support is phenomenal; the counselling tends to have a long waiting list but personal support has been very helpful and efficient. Academic support is great but I'd like more 1:1 feedback. Financial support has also been wonderful for me regarding low income bursaries so I can't fault the support system of the uni. I get involved in a few things but would like to do more in an ideal world. However, workload doesn't allow this. Overall, regarding advice and any problems, they've been extremely helpful! I chose to stay in my current halls for 2nd year also - they felt very safe yet fun and in a beautiful part of Edinburgh. However, previously I lived in different university-managed halls around Leith area and had a bad experience so moved after a few months. Very expensive...but overall, it's an expensive city and I knew when I applied so have generally budgeted a lot. There's always stuff going on, especially for the arts and it's quite a lovely place! Expensive!! Ridiculous entry fees for clubs! In comparison to home, the night life isn't great at all but I get involved elsewhere and save for bigger nights at home.

The program of study is quite good, the city is very nice and there's a lot of people to meet and have fun with.

The program of study is very good, but some of the lecturers lack in pedagogical skills. The facilities don't lack anything you might need, in my opinion, and everything is straightforward with using most of them. If you are in trouble with something, there is always an some organisation / person to help you with it. Haven't had that much experience with it, but I've heard mostly good things about it.

4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,environmental studies," The University of Edinburgh is in a fabulous location of an old historical city surrounded by beautiful architecture in a very student oriented society. There is some level of individual attention and personalization by the university with their inclusion of many clubs and societies as well as each students access to a personal tutor. However, too much emphasis is put on the student to learn outside the class rendering the lectures somewhat useless and resulting in a shaky understanding of the material. All of the lecturers were knowledgable and very charismatic about their areas of study but the classes themselves were not structured in the most conducive way to promote learning. There is too much emphasis on outside reading, which is not structured enough to keep all students on the same page of general knowledge on the course. Each student is awarded a personal tutor, who can be incredibly helpful to assist on an individual basis. However, not all tutors put in the same amount of effort to reach out to students as others. University accommodation is decent, with cleaners every week included. The city of Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and thus has a very lively night life and many options for activities and restaurants/shops to visit during the day, as well as plenty of historical sites and museums that are free to access. The University of Edinburgh has a huge emphasis on clubs and societies which are the best way to socialize with the rest of the student population, they plan many events and tend to meet weekly, and are highly supported by the university.",University Edinburgh fabulous location old historical city surround beautiful architecture student orient society level individual attention personalization university inclusion many club society well student access personal tutor However much emphasis put student learn class render lecture somewhat useless result shaky understanding material lecturer knowledgable charismatic area study class structure conducive way promote learning much emphasis outside reading structure enough keep student page general knowledge course student award personal tutor incredibly helpful assist individual basis However tutor put amount effort reach student others University accommodation decent cleaner week include city Edinburgh capital Scotland thus lively night life many option activity restaurants/shops visit day well plenty historical site museum free access University Edinburgh huge emphasis club society best way socialize rest student population plan many event tend meet weekly highly support university,edinburgh

4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Psychology MA," The University of Edinburgh is an amazing place to study, grow and explore. The staff is supportive and positive. The research and prospects for engagement in it are limitless. For an interested student are doors are practically open to a world of science and opportunities. There are many opportunities for feedback from the staff. There are also interesting student societies which can support you and entertain you and help you grow as a person. EUYSRA is a unique project originating from the University of Edinburgh which helps undergraduate students start their own research projects during their first years of studies, it even provides funding and academic support to members. The International Student Centre in which I have been involved for three years is a vibrant place for international students which makes the university more than a Scottish university. it makes it a great hub of nationalities, cultures and religions. Edinburgh University's main characteristic would be """"international"""". The feeling of being in the centre of the world, while being far north near the Highlands is a unique one for this place. I haven't been able to see what my job prospects are yet so I am conservative in my grading. The academic staff at the university is excellent and is producing world-class research. This is inspiring and there are many opportunities for the undergraduates to take part and benefit from the on-going research at the university. The courses load is well structured and the ration assignments-final exams is good. However, the requirements and study objectives are not always clear. A good researcher not always translates into a good lecturer and teacher. Thus, independent study is a crucial part of studying at this university. Taking on the responsibility of your education and making the most of the extracurricular opportunities on offer can take you a long way. The university provides perfect facilities for student. The Main Library is a convenient and cosy place to study. Computer labs are open 24 hours a day. There is specialized software available for free to psychology students. Labs are bookable for experimental sessions. The undergraduate might feel restricted in the first two years, however, until they find themselves around the facilities. Student support can vary. It depends to whom you turn to. I have had personal tutors who are not likely to help me but I have found help in places I haven't expected it. There are people at the university who are devoted to making student life easier. Student support officers and undergraduate directors might be intimidating names but the people behind them have done wonders for me in the hardest of times. The university accommodation facilities for 1st years are excellent. There is a full-catered centre (Pollock Halls) where I used to stay in my first year. This place feels like home and this is achieved through the hard work of staff who are paid to supervise, organize activities and break the ice between people. Events and opportunities to socialize are perfect at the university accommodation centres. Edinburgh is an exciting place to live in. It is a world heritage (UNESCO) city and has many landmarks. It is beautiful without doubt. The night life is safe and the large student population means that you will be surrounded by like-minded young people at most clubs and bars. However, the diversity of night life is not excellent and also going out can be quite expensive. The university has an excellent array of societies and clubs. The variety is amazing.

As I have lived in an international environment my whole life this is also something that I would look for in a university. All the events and societies as well as all friends I have made here make me think I could not have done the same in another university and that I have made the only possible right choice in coming to Edinburgh. There are job adverts in every Uni building I can think of and apart from that there are some societies that help with that too. And some of them look pretty amazing... If I wasn't a sometimes bored first year student not yet learning anything at all this would be a 5. Most lecturers are cool, smart and funny though so it can still be rewarding to go to lectures. Same goes for tutors. One thing that puts me off about this University is how far away King's Buildings, George Square and accommodation are apart from each other. The facilities themselves are great though. So far I managed to get good help whenever I actually needed it... A lot of the events they organize are weekly, but I found some more interesting ones for myself as well and so far found them worth going to. Pollock Halls is great, laundry isn't too expensive, the food is usually good (in my opinion, anyway) and living more or less together with thousands of students is also great. I have a strong dislike for nightclubs (which there are enough of even for those who do), but there's still stuff to do for me. Apart from Uni events there's pubs and ceilidhs among many things to try out here. Not to mention how ridiculously nice people here are...

But meeting so many nice people has made the journey not as scary as you might expect and it’s great living in a city like Leeds. I have a work placement in 2nd year which will help me with future job prospects. For students who are unsure about what they will do after graduation, there are talks and conferences which reassure students that this feeling if normal and there is information they can seek out about careers. The course itself is very interesting as well as the people you meet during your time here. The tutorials are really interactive and you get a real insight in other people’s thoughts as there is a good platform for debate in these sessions. However, the lecture classes are far too big so there is not enough individual focus. The quality of teaching can vary depending on the lecturer, some talk too quickly, some are monotonic. Scheduled lectures are also too spread out across the week; I would prefer to have a day off. Excellent. I am part of a tutor group and can meet with my personal tutor at any time. There is also a support team who work in my accommodation who you can approach with any problems you have about your living, flatmates, and even directions on how to get home if you are stranded late somewhere and need to get home. I do not involve myself with the SU. I pay £100 a week for self-catered halls, the rooms are good quality and the general area is very pretty. The problem I have with student accommodation is that they do not enquire about your character or personality so you are paired with flatmates who may not have anything in common with and it can be difficult to live and get along with them. Edinburgh is a really nice city and there are places which are great for nightlife. You can find most things you need on one street so it is easy to get around. I have joined the psychology society who are planning a trip to Amsterdam, I have already signed up for this.

5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Student Reviewer,09 Mar 15,Biological Sciences," It was fairly easy transitioning from high school to university. Lectures were fascinating, studying for the courses did not consume all of my time, and I had the opportunity to try out a lot of new activities through the societies, where I also connected with several new friends. The city is a veritable open air museum, with dozens of fascinating and breathtakingly beautiful places to visit. The University of Edinburgh is one of the universities with the highest employment rates after graduation in the UK. It also has a careers service and provides students with the necessary skills for them to find a job through the courses. My course starts by covering a broad range of topics, is taught by fascinating lecturers, and offers lots of hands-on experience through practicals and labs. The city is also a major bonus, being very multicultural and vibrant without being overwhelming. The university's facilities are excellent, from the libraries to the cafes and from the labs to the lecture theatres. Support is provided to students with physical disabilities or otherwise, as well as to students with financial problems, difficulties studying, and personal and medical issues. This support is provided bot by the university itself and by the students' association. Students receive regular notifications on the services available. The Students' Union is very active. It deals with a broad spectrum of matters, ranging from the prices at the cafes to equality and non-discrimination. It reaches out to the students through activities, regular updates and notifications, and gives students a chance to voice their opinions through an elaborate suggestion site and questionnaires. The UoE is traditionally a student-oriented university and respects the opinions of its students. The accommodation is very modern, albeit in an inconvenient location - far from the centre and my campus. Other accommodation sites are more central, however they are more antiquated. The best thing about Edinburgh is that there's an endless supply of activities. From walking along the cobble-stoned Royal Mile to climbing up Arthur's Seat, and from going on haunted ghost tours to having a hot chocolate in the Elephant House (where JK Rowling famously wrote some of the Harry Potter books), there's a thing for everyone in this amazing city.

All opinions are considered. I wasn't expecting Pollock Halls to be so good. I am sure that the university is going above and beyond to provide such service. Wish I could stay here for my whole degree. One reason I picked Edinburgh as the city of study was that it is the perfect student city.

The lecturers are all well-known figures in the field of anthropology. The university has two campuses - George square and King's Buildings. Both contain a library and Student union buildings. The Advice Place offers supports to students for a range of possible problems - accommodation, health, academic issues, etc. Moreover, each student is assigned a personal tutor, whom they can go to for advice on any enquiries they might have. I have only used the ones in the main campus - George Square - Pleasance, Potterrow and Teviot. Different kinds of events are organinsed daily in all three of them. I stayed in Pollock halls during my first year. The atmosphere is great. The RAs are friendly and welcoming and really try to make your first year a great experience.

I wish I could say more - perhaps I'm just bitter about Oxbridge rejection, but really, there's something missing. Nobody really had this as there first choice - when you ask, everyone was rejected from somewhere, or couldn't afford where they actually wanted to go. That atmosphere makes it difficult to enjoy at times. There is also isolation at King's - you're so far away from the Central Campus, and few of the buildings have the beautiful facades the university seems to prostitute on every prospectus cover. Many science students feel cheated, and as a matter of fact, some humanities students do too - some buildings in George Square clash horribly with the other, historical buildings. I think I'll manage, but I don't know whether that's my work ethic or the university's name =. The broad range of subjects covered within modules, flexibility of degree, outstanding lecturers. They are very good; I'm situated in King's, and the library facilities are immense. We have """"personal tutors"""" but that's just Edinburgh trying to replicate Oxbridge and failing. One half-hour meeting (if you're incredibly lucky) at the beginning of a term hardly constitutes a tutorial system. The biology lecturers were very supportive with our first essay, which was great. I'm not sure what they do, really. I'm in catered, Holland House, and it is probably the only house that hasn't been done up. The pantries are grim, not really any area for socialising etc.. Wander.

People from industry seem to appreciate the UoE as an institution. Some are really good, others (most thought by lecturers teaching the course for the first year) are quite poor in communication with the students. Extremely good.

However, this greatly varies from school to school- the Business School (where I was a student before), for example, is very organized and has a lot of funds. I wish I could say this of my own department. You need to watch out for yourself and do a lot of extracurricular stuff to be at the top of the list- but I imagine that this is the norm nowdays due to the demands of potential employers. unfortunately this varies greatly over departments and study years there are old and gloomy buildings from around the 70s (I'd say), but everything is being renovated. The new school of languages is fantastic, as is the extension of the David Hume Tower with underground facilities from last year. They have just refurbished an entire gym too with new, modern facilities. I can see that they are not sitting idle on a pile of money handed in by the students. Teviot is amazing as always, but I struggle to see what else the union does. Edinburgh is a beautiful touristic city, full of places to go, but this also means that prices can be high more than 200 societies to choose from.

The general standard of teaching is lower than at many places around the UK but the city is so good to live in that there is a constant trade off between a worthwhile educational experience and a genuinely engaging and vibrant student life. Frequent strikes and often poorly organised. The online system is rudimentary compared to other universities whilst the lecturers are often not very good at using its most basic functions. Overall quite good although can sometimes be confusing. There are so many departments for things that personal tutors have no idea where you should go to enquire about certain issues. EUSA are notorious for being the most opinionated and pointless student union in the country. Often campaign against relatively trifling matters rather than suggesting any useful change. Their crusade against the male members of the university is infantile and misguided. one of the best places in the country to live as a student.

1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,Student Reviewer,05 Feb 15,Business Management MA (Hons)," The University does not live up to is prestige name! The large number of students you would think would make it easy to make friends but it is the complete polar opposite, if you made it there off of your own back by obtaining good grades rather than Mummy and Daddy paying for you to be there you are the outsider and made aware of this constantly. It is full of public school students and foreign students meaning Scottish students feel like they are on an exchange. The standard of teaching is extremel poor and it is as if lecturers get in and out of the lecture as quickly as possible even if this means missing out part of the course that they have not been able to cover in the designated time period. Feedback is nonexistant and very little help or guidance is provided. In the four years i spent at this university i felt that instead of improving i was taking steps backwards. Not only this but the whole environment and feel of the university is distant from the City in which it inhabits so if you are drawn to the neauty of Edinburgh, the uinversity could not be more distant from this. In my four years it never made me realise who i was as a person, rather it destroyed me as a person, causing me depression which was then even more poorly helped by the university as the councilling sesions on offer were in the middle of the library meaning there was no confidentiality and a maximum of 6 sessions was allowed with no more after.",University live prestige name large number student think make easy make friend complete polar opposite make back obtain good grade rather Mummy Daddy pay outsider make aware constantly full public school student foreign student mean Scottish student feel exchange standard teaching extremel poor lecturer get lecture quickly possible even mean miss part course able cover designated time period Feedback nonexistant little help guidance provide year spend university felt instead improve take steps backwards Not whole environment feel university distant City inhabit draw neauty Edinburgh uinversity distant year never make realise person rather destroy person cause depression even poorly help university councilling sesions offer middle library meaning confidentiality maximum session allow,edinburgh

2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Student Reviewer,26 Nov 14,Scottish History MA (Hons)," Ok, but hugely overrated. I often felt as if the only reason I was there was to make money for the university. Some lecturers should never have been put in front of a class in the first place. Degrees from Edinburgh still carry some clout. Goodness knows how.  Throughout my time, I spent very little time on campus outside lectures and tutorials. The trip to the library was like entering death row, with hundreds of glum students jammed in between shelves of countless books. 
Despite this, most of them appeared to be watching Funny Cat Compilation Videos their equally miserable friends had sent them on BookFace. I recall when on a number of occasions, I would be in a desperate rush to print an essay or assignment, only to be prevented from doing so by a YouTube-addicted first year, taking a well-deserved break from his course on Semantic Externalism, by watching 'My Chihuahua Being a Chihuahua' or some similarly pointless drivel on the university computers.  Couldn't support a single American, never mind 10000 of them. But who can, really?  Good nachos.  Edinburgh's a good city to live in. Better than Glasgow.  Mostly run by ex-public schoolboys, dressed in tweed. No patience for those guys.

4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Student Reviewer,10 Nov 14,Mathematics BSc (Hons)," Edinburgh is a beautiful city and with a combined good student union, it makes way as a really fun place to study. There is so much to do here that you'll feel you won't have enough time to get through it all.
However, I didn't enjoy my course because it lacked what I came for which was Maths. In the first two years, you take many outside courses which is a benefit to most however I wanted to concentrate and learn about my subject. I made the mistake of coming to Edinburgh (coming from England) not knowing that their four year courses included many outside courses. This meant that I was not learning my course, Maths like I wanted to. The lectures themselves: in first year, lectures include clickers which allows students to communicate to one another when a question appears. The downside is that it takes up a lot of time hence, the depth of content isn't covered like it should be and I felt I wasn't learning as much as could do. 
The course at Edinburgh is the one reason why I wouldn't continue at this university hence the bad rating. Another reason is that many of the students didn't choose maths as their main course thus it was hard to meet people on my course with a general interest for it. 
If you can pick a subject that you do like here then you'll find you'll enjoy the rest of the university easily. Library is fantastic. Although it does get packed easily. However, the facilities are great and there's a good student vibe. George Square is where you feel the student vibe. Students everywhere walking about gives it the campus feeling that you wouldn't think it had because it is in the centre of the city.
A massive gym complex (CSE) nearby which is £106 a year. For great prices, the gym offers so much in terms of equipment. With a separate room for everything you really do feel you're getting your monies worth. 
There is a Blackwell's bookshop 5 minutes away from George Square which is handy for textbooks at lower prices. For maths, there is an online website where students asks for advice which is really good because all students can look at these. There is also a group called Maths Pals which allows students to go and ask for advice about anything. A lot of help is given on this that it is unfortunate the system for mathematics lectures were not the same. There are two main spots for the union, Potterow and Teviot. The latter is a Hogwarts like building that is upbeat inside. You really feel the student vibe when you're here. Potterow is where the night events happen however for such a big university, the facilities are quite small on a busy night.
For a night out, there are plenty of clubs (relatively small) yet enjoyable as well as pubs . The main residential hub is Pollock Halls. 2000 students live in this catered area and it is a great place to meet people. It's even worth the extra walk. 
I stayed in private accommodation (Chalmers Street) and apart for the price, all facilities were amazing. Double bed and massive kitchen is a big bonus for self catered. The only issue was that many of the people here were not from Edinburgh University hence it was difficult to mix in with my university. My advice is that if you would like an easy in for the social life, then go to Pollock Halls It's breathtaking when you get here and walk through the streets with all the cultural buildings. There's a castle in the middle of the city! The Prince's street area is great for shopping and the Scottish atmosphere all year round is great. There is much to do and walking up Arthur's seat (extinct volcano) gives you an thrilling view of Edinburgh.
Usually you'll have too much to do thus, it's hard to get all the fun city stuff in.  Clubs are great. In the cricket club there are many social events as well as training. Edinburgh are known for winning many club sport. The table tennis club and tennis club are run quite well and there are many new sports like Ultimate frisbee and Shinty that you can try out. 
The societies tend to die down after Freshers however in the ever cool sounding Maths society, events such as pub quizzes and pub golf are only a handful of events that go on. Societies tend to do families nights so that all years are brought together.

4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,Student Reviewer,28 Jan 14,Environment and Development MSc," To me, Edinburgh Uni is a classic university that is big, traditional and very diverse. You could find any kind of people and research there, simply because of its size.
The size means that many administrative processes are very slow and inefficient, but not as bad as to seriously affect your study experience. For example, they switched only recently to a new e-mail provider to replace the previous outdated e-mail provider (a change that had been done at my previous university, a small campus university, many years before). Generally, IT services are not very good. For example, staff and PhD student pages are seriously outdated and the university even recommends PhD students to create homepages on external blogging sites because the university is unable to provide its own platform.
The courses are generally of good quality, but not outstanding. At Edinburgh Uni, lecturers are completely normal people who do solid work. Most of them are very much under pressure to produce research output to maintain the high position in rankings which sometimes affects quality of teaching. 
Student accommodation at Edinburgh Uni is basically a scam. Rooms are much more expensive than on the private market and are mostly taken by rich (Chinese) students from overseas. I think this is the weakest point of the university. There is a lot of networking potential lost in making student accommodation accessible only to the rich.
The other weak point of the university are the high tuition fees, especially for overseas students. Basically, you only get either very rich people or people with scholarships.
Overall, it's the best university in Scotland and one of the best in the UK. Very well respected, but you won't appear overqualified (as might be a problem e.g. with an Oxbridge degree).",Edinburgh Uni classic university big traditional diverse find kind people research simply size size mean many administrative process slow inefficient bad seriously affect study experience example switch recently new e-mail provider replace previous outdated e-mail provider change do previous university small campus university many year Generally IT service good example staff PhD student page seriously outdated university even recommend PhD student create homepage external blogging site university unable provide platform course generally good quality outstanding Edinburgh Uni lecturer completely normal people solid work Most much pressure produce research output maintain high position ranking sometimes affect quality teach Student accommodation Edinburgh Uni basically scam Rooms much expensive private market mostly take rich Chinese student overseas think weak point university lot network potential lose make student accommodation accessible rich weak point university high tuition fee especially overseas student Basically get rich people people scholarship Overall 's best university Scotland best UK Very well respect n't appear overqualified problem e.g Oxbridge degree,edinburgh
5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,Student Reviewer,07 Dec 13,Biological Sciences BSc (Hons)," First off, Edinburgh is a fantastic place to live and study in. This University will open many doors for you in the future, particularly if you're studying science/medicine etc (I'm studying BSc Biological Sciences (Hons)). If you're also aspiring to do biology here, the course in the first semester isn't especially great but only because its very general as they're trying to show you all aspects of biology in order for you to accurately pick your honours with regards to your interests. The lecturer's/practical leaders are in general very good however it is a totally different way of learning from school so be prepared. There were a couple of particularly bad lecturer's but they change a lot so you're not going to have a bad one for long. The lecturer's who covered the difficult parts of the course were all fantastic. The accommodation however is DISGUSTING and is the only thing I'm not enjoying so far about being here. I stay in self-catered South Clerk Street and it really is horrible (mice, flies, constantly have no hot water, smell of dampness, bad kitchen appliances, bad furnishings in rooms, the list goes on...). However this is the most cheap accommodation and I have been in the nicer self-catered flats which seem very nice to live in and people who live there enjoy it so my advice is to steer clear of the University cheap self-catered flats. One huge good point though is that you meet so many really lovely people staying in halls, so I would recommend it, just not South Clerk Street! Pollock I have never been to however I've heard the food isn't all that great so it's a waste of money to go catered. Overall, I would recommend Edinburgh as it is the highest ranked Uni in Scotland(just now) and you will go places with a degree from here.

Warwick is an amazing university, the campus is lovely and the Film course is incredible.
However, the university has to improve its wellbeing services and has to revise it’s policies concerning security on campus and establish a zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual harassment and assault. This concerns a lot of universities and is not being talked about enough. Being a woman, I deserve the right to feel safe on my campus. 
Moreover, I think the university could have offered more than a rent waiver in regards to the covid situation and the numerous opportunities we didn’t get this year. The university sends invites to forums and links to webpages every week. However, as I am in first year I wouldn’t know too much about this. 5 The facilities are overall very nice and clean.

They constantly hold career talks and advice and even internship opportunities for all students through out the academic year so that you can be well informed on what you plan on doing next after university.

Its hard to quantify this because not everyone has used or accessed these facilties before and its been even harder during covid. So to what extent personal support has been impacted by covid is still yet to be seen, but the help I received was adequate, but it wasn't always easy and sometimes stressful getting the access to those personal support facilities.

The lecturers were quite drab in my opinion and the night life was appalling but am excited to see how things change next year. Plenty of societies and work fairs, they are always well advertised and due to a great community of like minded individuals I think the job prospects are excellent. 19 Plenty of room across campus however during lockdown the lack of space we were allowed to visit was awful. People were battling for space in small buildings and it was hard to find a place to study away from your own flat. Well being groups were a great help to me and it was easy to gain access to mental health support through an online portal. However I had great difficulty withdrawing my housing contract due to mental health as the disability team did not see it extreme enough which caused me great distress and after two months of constant battles and forms I was finally released from my contract.

3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,,4.0,2.0,Dan,27 Jan 20,Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)," Warwick is a great University for Academics and challenging courses, and the campus has some merits.
However, location is not great and is awkward to get to places.
The biggest thing the University does not take seriously is student living and the affordability of things from accommodation to drinks to laundry. All of these facilities/services they increase in cost every year, especially accommodation.
It's a good university but just be cautious. Now, the University does use a careers site so you can browse opportunities, there are multiple workshops and ultimately and crucially, it is down to you and you have to go out and seek opportunities with the university providing some support.
Could do a lot more though, to tell students that you need to get experience.
You are paying £9,250 at the end of the day. 8 As stated previously, the Student Union is good, but the washing machines can be pricey because run by private company who can charge lots for one single wash.
Crucially, not from experience but there have been a lot of complaints on handling mental health at the university.
 Tutors feedback is good, and you are assigned a personal tutor which you can go to at any time for help.
As I said, mental health services, as well as general health services should be improved, as you have to wait for months for an appointment! Good, and there is a focus on representation and an inclusive environment. 
Facilities are overall good, with cafes, pharmacy, a student union club which can be good and a terrace bar and some restaurants which are great and have made use of. Campus accommodation can be especially close to campus; good services but again the price :/// Good, and sports centre is new and has lots to offer.
However, to join sports club you have to pay a membership fee, then a fee to use facilities and then other costs - in short way more expensive than it needs to be.","Warwick great University Academics challenge course campus merit However location great awkward get place big thing University take seriously student living affordability thing accommodation drink laundry facilities/services increase cost year especially accommodation 's good university cautious Now University use career site browse opportunity multiple workshop ultimately crucially go seek opportunity university provide support lot tell student need get experience pay £9,250 end day state previously Student Union good washing machine pricey run private company charge lot single wash.

On a personal/social level to be honest this uni has disappointed me as I find most people do not have a work/life balance and the main focus during uni tends to be on their careers/after uni. However have also met some great people who this does not apply to. Lots of careers fairs, talks provided for all students-not just big departments e.g. law, business etc. Warwick is a forward thinking uni and its good rep also helps increase employability. 15 Very expensive and not reflective of student prices at all. Not that much option considering its a campus uni either. Not had to use counselling services so cant comment. Personal tutor assigned in first year and stays consistent throughout degree which is nice. They are there for support but to be honest they don't reach out that much and its more a matter of protocol to book a meeting with them. The clubbing is cheesy and not great - alright for an easy night on a Weds in first year, but wouldn't bother trekking there in second or third year from off campus. The SU seem to have made some good changes since I've been there, but I feel like there are more important aspects of the uni they could focus on improving/changing. Leamington is nice, peaceful and full of old people students and families. Nightlife is average for a campus uni but can get repetitive. Cov is not that busy and its quite grey and ugly.

5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Student Reviewer,10 Feb 17,," It has been great. I have had the opportunity to meet people from a range of cultures and backgrounds. I have had the chance to be part of many wonderful societies like RAG, HistSoc and LawSoc and I have also found my course to be interesting. I think that uni has its ups and downs and I'm not saying everything will be perfect but on the whole I've had a great time and I'm still learning from it. Several of the societies such as law, finance and history make an active effort to run talks on different fields you can go into and give you advice on getting into that career. Several skills you gain through being part of a society are transferable in employment such as teamwork and organisation. The careers department are also very active running talks, workshops and one on one sessions. As well as the general careers adviser, each department has its own career adviser dedicated to your degree, e.g. a history careers adviser. The best thing about my lecturers is the range of lecturers I have. With history at Warwick, every single lecture has someone who is a specialist in the topic they're lecturing on. It's nice not to have the same lecturer all the time and it keeps the course interesting. I also like the wide range of optional modules that history has, it's also easy to do an outside option from another discipline if you see one you're interested in. There is a large amount of working space, the library itself is 5 floors. There is also the Rootes learning grid and university house, both of which are nice places to do some work. As a history student, I also find the modern records centre particularly useful, Warwick's very own archive! There's plenty of sports facilities too from the gym in the sports centre to courts if you want to play a game of badminton or tennis. Academic feedback is really good, it is often prompt and it's quite easy to see your tutor in their office hours or find one of your lecturers if there is something you don't understand or are worried about. Personal support I would say is also there, but you actually have to look for it to be able to make full use of it. If you know who to go to and who to ask for personal support then there's so much available to you The Student Union is really active. They run so many events ranging from socials like the famous weekly POP! all the way to advice on student housing. At Warwick, there are over 250 societies so there's a wide range of activities to choose from. You can also start your own society if you feel as though there isn't anything you're interested in. In my 1st year, I lived in halls. I was in Westwood and my room was spacious and had a sink. My flat was huge, there was 21 of us and there was a common room which meant we could socialise with other people too. Sharing showers and toilets wasn't an issue at all, not once did I have to wait and they were cleaned regularly. This year, I'm living in Leamington, we went through private housing and our landlord has been wonderful, any problem we've had he has been more than happy to fix. From what I read about Warwick's city life before coming here, I can say I've been pleasantly surprised. In first year, although it was a 10 minute bus drive from the nearest city Coventry, this wasn't really an issue as anything we needed was in reach. Fancied a coffee? We could go to the costa on campus or curiositea. Fancied a meal? We could go to one of the on campus restaurants like bar fusion. It's nothing like the city life of London, Manchester or Birmingham but it's definitely not as bad as I was made to think it was before coming here. If we ever do get tired of the Warwick bubble, we simply venture out a bit further to Birmingham which is 20 minutes on the train. There's a crazy amount of clubs and societies to choose from, over 250! There really is something for everyone and if you don't like anything on offer, there's the opportunity to create your own society!",great opportunity meet people range culture background chance part many wonderful society RAG HistSoc LawSoc also find course interesting think uni ups down 'm say everything perfect whole 've great time 'm still learn Several society law finance history make active effort run talk different field go give advice get career Several skill gain part society transferable employment teamwork organisation career department also active run talk workshop session As well general career adviser department career adviser dedicate degree e.g history career adviser best thing lecturer range lecturer history Warwick single lecture someone specialist topic 're lecture 's nice lecturer time keep course interesting also wide range optional module history 's also easy outside option discipline see 're interested large amount work space library floor also Rootes learn grid university house nice place work history student also find modern record centre particularly useful Warwick archive 's plenty sport facility gym sport centre court want play game badminton tennis Academic feedback really good often prompt 's quite easy see tutor office hour find lecturer something n't understand worry Personal support say also actually look able make full use know go ask personal support 's much available Student Union really active run many event range social famous weekly POP way advice student housing Warwick society 's wide range activity choose also start society feel n't anything 're interested year live hall Westwood room spacious sink flat huge common room mean socialise people Sharing shower toilet n't issue wait clean regularly year 'm live Leamington go private housing landlord wonderful problem 've happy fix read Warwick city life come say 've pleasantly surprise first year minute bus drive near city Coventry n't really issue anything need reach Fancied coffee go costa campus curiositea Fancied meal go campus restaurant bar fusion 's nothing city life London Manchester Birmingham 's definitely bad make think come ever get tire Warwick bubble simply venture bit Birmingham minute train 's crazy amount club society choose really something everyone n't like anything offer 's opportunity create society,warwick
4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,Student Reviewer,04 Feb 17,Psychology BSc (Hons)," It's been very positive - good lecturers, good facilities and a generally good and supportive environment. I have enjoyed the brilliant library. Although I must say the campus is expensive when it comes to cafes and coffee bars. The careers department here is quite pro-active, they invite guest speakers who have used the same degree to come and speak, they offer careers advice about your given exit routes, CV writing and offer practice interviews. They provide plenty of opportunity to increase presentation skills and to work in teams to produce work. I think the diversity in knowledge and areas of specialist interest is high in this department and that I find facinateing Pretty good I think, we also have the added bonus of the brand new Oculus building, the Arts Centre and shops and bank within campus. Personally I think it is excellent. Very good academic support with personal tutors and approachable staff. I have used the counselling service and it's great, as is Nightline and the mental well being team I don't get involved very much, as I am a mature student with children and therefore don't get the time to really participate.

5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,,,4.0,Student Reviewer,25 Jan 17,Psychology BSc (Hons)," My experience at Warwick uni has been amazing! I will be sad to leave this year and recommend it to any student who is after a brilliant uni that will provide you with a brilliant experience and education. Warwick holds careers fares regularly which provides students with the opportunity to meet people from various companies. There is also opportunities to meet with a careers advisor to discuss anything career related, such as getting help with writing your CV. Also I always get emails offering training in various skills, for example computer skills, that are very useful across any career. Psychology is a brilliant course! I'm in my third year now and have loved every year of it. My lecturers are all very engaging, enthusiastic and approachable and every lecture is interesting. My lectures are also recorded which is very useful if you miss a lecture and also when you go back to revise your lectures. The library is huge and you can almost always find a place to work. I tend to spend most of my time in there because it has quiet areas for when you want to get on with work but also has areas where you can sit with friends and talk, as well as having nice cafes within the library. There is also a supermarket on campus which has almost everything you might need but it is quite pricey. From my experience and from what I've heard from other people tutors are generally very helpful. In the past whenever I've had a problem with work my tutor has always been quick to respond with an answer/solution. Although I have not needed to use any counselling services, I am aware that there is counselling available to students and always see posters for Nightline which allows students to contact someone during the night if they have any issues. When I have used the SU it's good but I only tend to only go there for food or to play pool. I haven't really got involved this year though because of the workload that comes with being in third year. N/A I joined the belly dancing society, which is a lot of fun and is taught by both students and trained professionals for a cheap price. I would definitely recommend joining a society as it helps you to meet new people.",experience Warwick uni amaze sad leave year recommend student brilliant uni provide brilliant experience education Warwick hold career fare regularly provide student opportunity meet people various company also opportunity meet career advisor discuss anything career relate get help write CV Also always get emails offering training various skill example computer skill useful career Psychology brilliant course 'm third year love year lecturer engaging enthusiastic approachable lecture interest lecture also record useful miss lecture also go back revise lecture library huge almost always find place work tend spend time quiet area want get work also area sit friend talk well nice cafe library also supermarket campus almost everything need quite pricey experience 've hear people tutor generally helpful past whenever 've problem work tutor always quick respond answer/solution need use counselling service aware counsel available student always see poster Nightline allow student contact someone night issue use SU 's good tend go food play pool n't really get involve year workload come third year N/A join belly dancing society lot fun teach student trained professional cheap price definitely recommend join society help meet new people,warwick

A lot of firms do often come onto campus to exhibit and run events for students. There's however a very marginal presence of non profit organisations,civil society, volunteering and public sector organisations on campus. Lectures are very well organised, but seminars could be improved a bit more to make them more engaging and stimulating. The facilities are all of a good quality. Shuttle bus services, 24 hour study spaces and lecture recording services for some lectures are just a few of the many in thus category. Student academic support is highly inadequate but non academic support on the other hand is much better. The SU is great however it is too bureaucratic at the moment and could benefit from being more decentralised and informal in engaging with students l. The Warwick accommodation maintenance service does a very good job in responding quite swiftly to complaints and faults. The environment isn't too bad at all for a campus university. There's pretty much every other facility students will need in a city provided to a reasonable level. This ranges from a very modern arts centre featuring a galleries for exhibitions famous and upcoming artists, two cinemas and lots of restaurants. Clubs could improve by having more programmes for beginners and first years.

However, feel maybe the support for non-law students getting into law could be better, after being told to go to a CV workshop when they were all filled and then no more support regarding how to improve my CV, cover letters and answers for applications. Lectures vary in excellence, a basic handout would be good for each lecture to outline the basics for each theme. Some lecturers speak far too fast and fly through the lecture, others do not speak loud enough. In addition, the workload has been very intense with essays due most weeks on top of seminar reading and actual long essay deadlines due, still have no time to start them. Some seminars are interactive, very useful and enjoyable, other seminars are dull, tutor on his phone or does not appear to be listening to our presentations or set any reading which makes the seminar static and not always useful. Library needs a better stock of history books in quantity as the book you always want is already taken. In addition, would be good to have more of the recent historiography books. Sometimes do not feel I can approach module tutors and discuss concerns with essays and modules. Some tutors are excellent and very quick at responding to emails, others take a week. Marking essays has become slower, taking over a month to get essay feedback which is concerning when trying to write long essays based from short essays. SU is quite small and only circle/Pop is a good night on wednesday. Would be great to create some more SU nights. Fresher halls were excellent.Uni off campus accommodation good/ok - when first arrived the shower was broken, hot water would not reach the third floor, broken oven. However, the rooms are large and have a enough desk space to work and comfy double bed. Difficult not living in a city there is not very much going on in Leamington Spa. Would be great to have some more places to go out, bars but also chill areas, daytime activities. I play for the ladies hockey club, great people and made lots of friends, plenty of socials as well as fitness, training and matches. I am part of the law society, would be nice if they could include and create more activities for non-law students to feel more included and have a better understanding of the GDL process and funding as well as securing vacation scheme placements and training contracts.",really enjoy time Warwick however recently encounter number issue think address Warwick hold number career fair even networking session presentation huge number business law firm excellent praise university However feel maybe support non-law student get law good tell go CV workshop fill support regard improve CV cover letter answer application Lectures vary excellence basic handout good lecture outline basic theme lecturer speak far fast fly lecture others speak loud enough addition workload intense essay due week top seminar reading actual long essay deadline due still time start seminar interactive useful enjoyable seminar dull tutor phone appear listen presentation set reading make seminar static always useful Library need good stock history book quantity book always want already take addition good recent historiography book Sometimes feel approach module tutor discuss concern essay module tutor excellent quick respond email others take week Marking essay become slow take month get essay feedback concern try write long essay base short essay SU quite small circle/Pop good night wednesday great create SU night Fresher hall excellent.Uni campus accommodation first arrive shower break hot water reach third floor broken oven However room large enough desk space work comfy double bed Difficult live city much go Leamington Spa great place go bar also chill area daytime activity play lady hockey club great people make lot friend plenty social well fitness training match part law society nice include create activity non-law student feel included good understanding GDL process funding well secure vacation scheme placement training contract,warwick
4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Politics," I have had few problems with the University itself, the main issues are expense (travel costs, etc) and finding like-minded people to make things easier. Easier than at other Universities, but still difficult. The flexibility allows me to study in a way which suits me well and would enable others to do the same despite differences, plus any resource is openly available to me. Mostly good, particularly in terms of flat maintenance. The distance between the nearest town and the University makes some facilities difficult to access. Personal Tutors provide good support academically, nightline is in place and there is a good counselling service. Good range of activities both night time and daytime, easily accessible if you have problems, sometimes a little expensive. Although I pay more than most for my University accommodation, I believe that none of it is below par and it caters to people's options. In the summer months I like going to the parks, I also enjoy the markets that sometimes visit and how readily available the shops and facilities are.

Although they push you hard, they also make you reach your full potential. The campus is lovely, with lakes, parks, a own sportscentre and the largest Arts Centre in the UK outside of London. If you come to Warwick, you will definetly not regret. I have not.  With all its fairs, and good work from the Carriers and Skills Centre, you are certain to find the perfect job for you. I do Economics, and I love all my lectureres. They are so enthusiastic about their subects and that affects the students. The campus is HUGE. I've been a student here for half a year, and I haven't really yet had the need to leave campus.  I havent had many problems since I got here, but with the few incuiries Ive had, I got excelent help from the university! I love their work, and their parties are amazing (for those caring about that). The campus accomodations are great!

Generally good, nightline service etc - sometimes necessary to go looking for support but is there. Societies amazing, so many opportunities to grow and have great times.

4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Student Reviewer,16 Dec 14,Film and Literature BA (Hons)," A very campus-centre uni that offers the full experience of nightlife, sociability and the learning side of everything too. Good facilities, and outstanding teachers at the forefront of research. Loads of career-centred activities and fairs on all the time, graduate employers directly come onto campus and seek out Warwick students and loads of people secure internships, work experience placements and much more just because they have attended the university. Love my course, my favourite part of the experience. Teachers are so knowledgeable and you know you are being taught by the pioneers of the study of Film. They expect high levels of commitment but you know you're getting a worthwhile degree out of it; it's not a joke course but something that these teachers are fully invested in and they really care about your contributions to seminars.  Library is amazing but never enough space; the actual book lending part cannot be beaten, they have such a fantastic range of interesting and relevant books! If you had time and you really liked your course, there's loads to choose from and I have found the library the number one most helpful thing in regards to revision and essay writing obviously. Only issue is that they should patrol people in there because so many sit on Facebook and take up a space that someone could use to actually work... However, learning grids are all great too, there's loads of places to drink/eat (expensive though..would suggest not eating on campus) and the facilities like kitchens and toilets are always really clean. It's okay, some people are really helpful when you have issues but at other times they are not so good. No point ever trying to raise a complaint to the SU as they do not take you seriously and don't try to help. Also NEVER use Warwick Accommodation to get your house after you move off campus! Worst people ever, do not trust them or believe them, they refuse to sort out any house issues and avoid and avoid emails and phone calls and squirm out of all responsibilities. They sort no house damage or structural damage, will not repair anything, do not give inventories and couldn't even bill us on time. DO NOT GET YOUR HOUSE WITH THEM. Not worth it, too expensive and the nightlife is better outside of campus. However the actual SU in terms of the team are really great and take care of issues quickly and efficiently. Also, the SU releases random statements boycotting/against certain things and not others... not the most representative democratic situation. Good, not amazing but it all depends how much you want to pay; cheaper rooms like the ones I stayed in were fine for my needs, sharing a bathroom WAS SO EASY and NOTHING to be scared of! I paid £91 a week and had a friend paying £134 a week just for the en suite...not worth it, save your money and just cope with sharing the bathrooms as it isn't the end of the world. All amenities worked really well, hot water, electricity, heating etc was never a problem. Any issues and security would come over really fast so sort it. I love Leamington Spa which is where I live as a 2nd year currently. Pretty town, very safe, and loads to do. I am from a city so it's nice to be near something that is like home. Shopping is awesome (sorry bank account) and the local family owned shops are great. No complaints about prices either, you can't beat the student discounts in Leamington, with drinks at 75p a shot and take outs etc all taking into account the student population. Loads of family areas too, so not just all student-y. Film Society is really good so far, such a big range of things to join so you won't be short of choice. Everyone is kind and welcoming even if you want to start something new. However, would say sports societies are not welcoming and are elitist, no such thing as just joining a sport for a laugh or to try it at Warwick as they are so cliquey and do 'initiations' in which people who want to join have to do stuff like strip off and drink or eat curry powder etc... would rather not, thanks. However normal societies are great and arrange loads of trips/events and stuff. They seem to be really accepting of all types of people no matter what beliefs/religion/race etc, never ever encountered any problems, and they arrange events that cater to both people that do and don't drink/enjoy clubbing.",campus-centre uni offer full experience nightlife sociability learning side everything Good facility outstanding teacher forefront research Loads career-centred activity fair time graduate employer directly come campus seek Warwick student load people secure internship work experience placement much attend university Love course favourite part experience Teachers knowledgeable know teach pioneer study Film expect high level commitment know 're get worthwhile degree 's joke course something teacher fully invest really care contribution seminar Library amaze never enough space actual book lend part beat fantastic range interesting relevant book time really like course 's load choose find library number helpful thing regard revision essay write obviously Only issue patrol people many sit Facebook take space someone use actually work However learn grid great 's load place drink/eat expensive .. suggest eat campus facility kitchen toilet always really clean 's okay people really helpful issue time good point ever try raise complaint SU take seriously n't try help Also NEVER use Warwick Accommodation get house move campus Worst people ever trust believe refuse sort house issue avoid avoid email phone call squirm responsibility sort house damage structural damage repair anything give inventory n't even bill time DO NOT GET YOUR HOUSE WITH THEM Not expensive nightlife well campus However actual SU term team really great take care issue quickly efficiently Also SU release random statement boycotting/against certain thing others representative democratic situation Good amaze depend much want pay cheap room one stay fine need share bathroom WAS SO EASY NOTHING scar pay week friend pay week en suite save money cope share bathroom n't end world amenity work really well hot water electricity heat etc never problem issue security come really fast sort love Leamington Spa live year currently Pretty town safe load city 's nice something home Shopping awesome sorry bank account local family own shop great complaint price n't beat student discount Leamington drink shot take out take account student population Loads family area student-y Film Society really good far big range thing join n't short choice Everyone kind welcome even want start something new However say sport society welcome elitist thing join sport laugh try Warwick cliquey 'initiations people want join stuff strip drink eat curry powder etc rather thanks However normal society great arrange load trips/events stuff seem really accept type people matter beliefs/religion/race etc never ever encounter problem arrange event cater people n't drink/enjoy club,warwick

Lack of stress on volunteer experiences/work experience, promise student mentors but have never met any on my course. However, it's a very picturesque campus and a good place to be. Not necessarily a good uni for all subjects - they place a lot of emphasis and invest more into science subjects. Fail to stress the importance of getting work experience. You only get info if you actively seek it. More academically based, rather than focused on how you can use your degree once you're done. Not a particularly good uni for psychology - a lot more investment in other areas. However, have a good range of courses and allow outside modules.

They give you an opportunity to discuss things you're unsure of and go over difficult topics. I enjoy the sports halls and squash courts. I didn't get gym membership because it was too expensive, so I guess that could be improved. My personal tutor has been helpful with a difficult course, and some of the careers talks and events are quite useful sometimes. The student union is ok for opportunities with various clubs, but there's no stand out great night and the drinks can be expensive if you want to order something a bit different.

The best thing about my course is the great variety of modules on offer. Wish we had another fridge in our kitchen! Other than that facilities are great. The campus itself is a really nice place to hang out. Careers services are great. There's also things like nightline and student support officers. Also each kitchen has a resident tutor to sort out any problems. The SU is great. Lots of different events on and great variety. If you go at the right time, there's good drinks deals to be had as well. Terrace bar is good. Accommodation is nice and fairly good value.

Also, everything is in close proximity so you're a stones throw away from all the sporting facilities and academic facilities. Everything is great. I've had a few encounters with Warwick's student finance as they were not very co-operative or helpful. It's really good. A nice setup and occasionally hosts really good nights.

Boring and tiresome. Facilities at the university are average compared to others I've seen. The gym is nice and new but needs to be bigger. Also, they need to have more of a contingency plan for bad weather with the sports pitches. I haven't used any support services or even been made aware of any.

Not too much in the way of nightlife but leamington and coventry both have a few clubs to offer. Also Birmingham isn't too far away and they offer transport services to take you there and back for nights out. Can't be too hard right? I think Warwick is supposed to be good for that kind of thing. The best thing about my course is that often we finish our lectures early. Facilities are not bad, but could be improved by providing more pubs in and around campus. There are only really 2 to choose from. This is not applicable for me, as I haven't used the support services. Love it. Lot's of stuff to do, although after a while the same nights do get a bit old. They should try and change it up a a bit, and make the drinks cheaper so that people are more inclined to go and the club would be busier. £50 extra for an en-suite seems a bit much.
