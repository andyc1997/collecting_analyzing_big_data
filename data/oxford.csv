At this point I would like to point out that I studied Oriental Studies Japanese at Oxford (BA) but WhatUni doesn't list this course so I have to leave a review for the MSt (sorry). \nSome lecturers were fine, but unfortunately the organisation of the Oriental Institute was so terrible that I felt it greatly disadvantaged the students on the course. Such as:\n- Course options listed in the prospectus were suddenly made unavailable in the term before specialisation, meaning that students who had wanted to study, for example, Japanese theatre or sociology, now had to choose between linguistics, literature or politics. Although the lecturers had sufficient time to warn us of this, they refused to respond to our requests, and in fact shouted at the students who enquired above the departmental lecturers, as though it wasn't a reasonable request to want to know which options would be available!\n- In the second year, students were required to attend daily lectures at the Chinese institute, which were provided for the benefit of Sinologist students. The course content was not relevant to the Japanese exam contents. One wonders why the students were thus required to attend.\n- Course was changed for the lower years meaning the new students had to try to learn modern and classical Japanese in the same year, which of course was impossible. Imagine trying to teach Shakespeare to a Japanese high schooler learning to say 'hello' - you just wouldn't do it. But the Oxford Oriental Institute would!\n- Grades for the annual exams were publicly circulated by the lecturers amongst the students. \n- No pastoral support during the year abroad. Not even to help students find a placement before they left. No guidebook. No advice as to our student status during that year, which led to some students' final year funding being cancelled. \n- Not all the material was covered before the final exams. Lecturers not bothered, although \n- Contents of the final exams changed three weeks prior to final exams.\n- Final exam format being significantly different to what we had been told (ie 'In this exam you will not be required to read' and then having a reading section). \n- As far as the famous Oxford tutorial system of one-on-ones with your lecturers, this did not exist for the Oriental Studies Japanese course. Our tutorials in final year were with a group of five students and one lecturer. That is a seminar, not an Oxford tutorial.\n- No official 'head of course' or person who would respond to our enquiries, doubts or concerns. \nAll in all, I could not have had a more disappointing experience at Oxford. I hear the Chinese Institute is much more organised, so perhaps that course would be worth considering in place of this one. I could recommend the Japanese course to wealthy students with nerves of steel, who require four hours sleep a night and no social life, who enjoy linguistics, history and classical Japanese. If you are remotely interested in sociology or any humanities aspect, pick any other course. Honestly at the end I was broken and totally disillusioned with Oxford. 0/10.""}",rat5,"{""How good are your university's facilities?"": 'Excellent librairies'}",rat2,"{'How good is the support offered by the uni?
