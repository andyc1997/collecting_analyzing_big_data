rat1,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat2,ratN,,,,,Paulomi,26 May 21,Civil Engineering MEng (Hons), This year I gave a very low rating because of coronavirus. I felt the level of teaching was nowhere near what it needed to be especially in a practical subject such as engineering. I felt unprepared especially after an online term 3 last year and my mental health definitely suffered at various points throughout the year. I felt that the overall experience was not indicative of the £9250 spent towards it not even including living costs. School of engineering specific is very good with a placement officer. Not sure about rest of the university 20 They are available but many feel they are more for university quotas than helping students. No

rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat3,ratN,,,,,Meera,26 May 21,History BA (Hons)," I think in certain areas Warwick are very good - eg their careers services. But other areas they fall down on. They claim to champion well-being, but I don’t think many people (especially first years) know all the avenues available to them, and I know some people who have had terrible experiences going to these services. They also routinely fail to listen to the student body, ignoring many protests and votes. My experience this year hasn’t been great, but that’s mainly due to the pandemic and not being able to go out, which isn’t the uni’s fault. 6 No"
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat2,ratN,,,,,Violette,26 May 21,Film Studies BA (Hons)," I really enjoyed my time on campus, and even being online at home.
Warwick is an amazing university, the campus is lovely and the Film course is incredible.
However, the university has to improve its wellbeing services and has to revise it’s policies concerning security on campus and establish a zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual harassment and assault. This concerns a lot of universities and is not being talked about enough. Being a woman, I deserve the right to feel safe on my campus. 
Moreover, I think the university could have offered more than a rent waiver in regards to the covid situation and the numerous opportunities we didn’t get this year. The university sends invites to forums and links to webpages every week. However, as I am in first year I wouldn’t know too much about this. 5 The facilities are overall very nice and clean. Wellbeing services are overwhelmed and probably understaffed as the access to in-person or one-on-one meetings is incredibly limited. There is a month-long waitlist (at least) for any appointment which is considerably too much. No"

rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat3,ratN,,,,,Bunny,06 May 21,Mathematics and Statistics BSc (Hons)," No doubt the pandemic will have had a role in reducing the full range of access to support and facilties from all parts of the University and subsequently reduce this year's university experience especially with the lack of face to face teaching of lectures and seminars, however the ability to interact with personal & course tutors together with the chance of meeting new people and still be able to access the limited range of services was a great experience that I wouldn't change for anything. They constantly hold career talks and advice and even internship opportunities for all students through out the academic year so that you can be well informed on what you plan on doing next after university. The help and the interaction from tutors is satisfactory, but the online format can be difficult and frustrating at times if you don't understand something or need to ask a question. Due to covid we obviously haven't been able to have access to the full range of facilities the university has to offer but the limited range. However this on its own has been useful so I have no doubt that the full range would been even more helpful. Its hard to quantify this because not everyone has used or accessed these facilties before and its been even harder during covid. So to what extent personal support has been impacted by covid is still yet to be seen, but the help I received was adequate, but it wasn't always easy and sometimes stressful getting the access to those personal support facilities.

The lecturers were quite drab in my opinion and the night life was appalling but am excited to see how things change next year. Plenty of societies and work fairs, they are always well advertised and due to a great community of like minded individuals I think the job prospects are excellent. 19 Plenty of room across campus however during lockdown the lack of space we were allowed to visit was awful. People were battling for space in small buildings and it was hard to find a place to study away from your own flat. Well being groups were a great help to me and it was easy to gain access to mental health support through an online portal. However I had great difficulty withdrawing my housing contract due to mental health as the disability team did not see it extreme enough which caused me great distress and after two months of constant battles and forms I was finally released from my contract.

There have been many instances of disorganisation from lecturers or departments which can be frustrating when students are already stressed. I miss learning in person and having proper contact hours. Overall it has been manageable however but very strenuous. The support is widely available to people who want it and know where to look. However I still believe the university could take a more active approach. 2 Right now only a few learning spaces are open but the equipment and facilities are quite good. There are a lot of options available in terms of support but I believe the university could take a more active role in personal support. No

Poor careers advice team, as although attached to the medical school have little knowledge regarding how individual specialities work post medical school. 30 No issues.

rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,ratN,,,,,Olivia,10 Apr 21,Engineering MEng (Hons), Online learning has made the course very different from what it was before lockdown; while lecturers and staff try to give as much support as possible it is nowhere near the same as in person teaching.

My seminar tutors have been really supportive and given me helpful feedback to do better. 
We should pay less this year, we barley had face to face so we didn’t get the full money value I’m still in uni so I don’t have much to say on this, however the Warwick Internship site and even it’s partnership with Unitemp has been so helpful 10 They provide a lot of online book, which in this covid time has been really helpful
I haven’t really explored their other facilities I personally have not had a bad experience , when I thought I was dyslexic they gave me support and when covid hit, the called all students asking how they were mentally etc however recent news will let you know that when it comes to other aspects they are lacking in student support No"

The department is helpful and understanding of everyone’s personal circumstances and has always found a way to help organise something for me (e.g a seminar needing to reallocated) without issue. Term 1 was a mix of online and in person. Seminars were in person (x4 a week), everything else was asynchronous and pre-recorded. 
Term 2 was online only. Seminars 4x a week but always on MS teams. Good library resources and COVID space study spaces. World class health facilities. Great equipment in gym. No"

Teaching offered has also been of good quality, but online learning is not as engaging as in-person. lots of opportunities are shared within my department, and also by other bodies, such as the student union, and departments that are focussed on career development. good access to transport, main campus, and lots of services available on campus.

It could have been better if pandemic and online classes were not there but it’s still amazing. We feel at home with Warwick and the experience of being a part of such big community is great. The university is prestigious and allow us to have great career opportunities. All around I’m happy here. There are so many workshops, guest lectures and events organised that it makes it so easy to develop networks. 6 The atmosphere of university is amazing. Everything feels sophisticated and A grade. It is clean at all times and it’s very very spacious and the architecture is quite modern. They run special services to cope with mental tiredness and students who are feeling home sick.

rat1,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat2,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 20,Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Secondary (11-18)," Would not go. Staff are abusive towards trainees, and facilitate abuse (including racism and sexism) by their partner schools. 
Uses threats to force trainees to not complain, and classes any grievances as due to a “lack of professionalism” on the part of the trainee.
Used invented allegations against trainees submitted without any evidence whatsoever in order to marginalise disfavoured students, and on multiple occasions outright refused to provide details and evidence with their accusations.
Complaints procedure focuses only on covering the staff and not resolving problems. Placement based course so irrelevant question. 8 Good library etc. Access to counselling service was ok. Ostensibly good but never used by myself. Was a building site for the whole year and never finished properly. Always builders coming in and out and was forced to evacuate due to a faulty fire alarm. Good city to live in, nightlife and transport etc all good Ostensibly good but never used by myself."
rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,,rat1,rat1,rat1,rat1,Student Reviewer,09 May 20,Accounting and Finance MSc, Warwick university is a big avoid!!! They like to charge the fees for facilities that are not there. The library is very dated. Tutors do not seem to care especially at postgrad level. The admin team and not bothered by class sizes being overflowed for seminars. 20 It was not great. University tutors took forever replying to emails and sometimes they ignored it and you had to go personally find their office. Most of which they’ll never be in there It was very poor and bad for student health with a mould issue and incompetent staff No. Warwick campus is very far from everything and has a pretty rubbish social life
rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,,rat5,rat5,Bradley,29 Jan 20,Civil Engineering MEng (Hons)," It’s been pretty good, it’s a good uni especially for my course. Good lecturers on the whole and good range of sports and societies. Nice campus with lots of green spaces. A bit 20 Alright Alright Yeah Good"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat4,,rat4,rat2,Dan,27 Jan 20,Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)," Warwick is a great University for Academics and challenging courses, and the campus has some merits.
However, location is not great and is awkward to get to places.
The biggest thing the University does not take seriously is student living and the affordability of things from accommodation to drinks to laundry. All of these facilities/services they increase in cost every year, especially accommodation.
It's a good university but just be cautious. Now, the University does use a careers site so you can browse opportunities, there are multiple workshops and ultimately and crucially, it is down to you and you have to go out and seek opportunities with the university providing some support.
Could do a lot more though, to tell students that you need to get experience.
You are paying £9,250 at the end of the day. 8 As stated previously, the Student Union is good, but the washing machines can be pricey because run by private company who can charge lots for one single wash.
Crucially, not from experience but there have been a lot of complaints on handling mental health at the university.
 Tutors feedback is good, and you are assigned a personal tutor which you can go to at any time for help.
As I said, mental health services, as well as general health services should be improved, as you have to wait for months for an appointment! Good, and there is a focus on representation and an inclusive environment. 
Facilities are overall good, with cafes, pharmacy, a student union club which can be good and a terrace bar and some restaurants which are great and have made use of. Campus accommodation can be especially close to campus; good services but again the price :/// Good, and sports centre is new and has lots to offer.
However, to join sports club you have to pay a membership fee, then a fee to use facilities and then other costs - in short way more expensive than it needs to be."

There are FB groups, an active careers department and people wiling to network/have careers fairs. 10 There are plenty of facilities but I feel like the uni could invest a bit more in terms of space Counselling workers are terrible, although academic feedback is good (depends on the course etc.) The SU can sometimes implement useless policies and make people jump through hoops Csot is low, location is convenient Living in Coventry, the city centre is 10 mins away. There's nothing too hard to find. There are plenty of welcoming sports and societies!"

rat3,rat5,rat4,rat1,rat3,,rat2,,rat4,rat4,Hannah,16 Nov 18,English and ITalian BA (Hons)," Been academically engaging and challenging (in a good way). On a personal/social level to be honest this uni has disappointed me as I find most people do not have a work/life balance and the main focus during uni tends to be on their careers/after uni. However have also met some great people who this does not apply to. Lots of careers fairs, talks provided for all students-not just big departments e.g. law, business etc. Warwick is a forward thinking uni and its good rep also helps increase employability. 15 Very expensive and not reflective of student prices at all. Not that much option considering its a campus uni either. Not had to use counselling services so cant comment. Personal tutor assigned in first year and stays consistent throughout degree which is nice. They are there for support but to be honest they don't reach out that much and its more a matter of protocol to book a meeting with them. The clubbing is cheesy and not great - alright for an easy night on a Weds in first year, but wouldn't bother trekking there in second or third year from off campus. The SU seem to have made some good changes since I've been there, but I feel like there are more important aspects of the uni they could focus on improving/changing. Leamington is nice, peaceful and full of old people students and families. Nightlife is average for a campus uni but can get repetitive. Cov is not that busy and its quite grey and ugly. Really good range"

Degree is interesting Careers events are regular and allows me to attend events in a range of sectors. Sports facilities are adequate. Humanities building is run down but effective. I believe counselling opportunities such as night line are good, tutors are very responsive to emails regarding essay advice etc. Good facilities to eat/drink and chill Coventry is boring and Leamington, whilst better, has little to offer.

They give feedback and counselling. The cities around campus vary. Leamington is nice and Birmingham as well but Coventry isn't nice.

Brilliant. Helpful careers service with great links and mentoring opportunities- so much experience through societies. Outstanding research facilities inc. online resources, always somewhere to go. Tutors and Careers services are outstanding. Entire support network on offer. Fantastic range of societies though too much emphasis on clubbing/ heavy drinking societies. Fabulous, spacious room with handy en-suite and cleaning service. Quite far from campus but lovely setting. Good transport links but no real cultural/ shopping facilities immediately nearby. Great range of societies with brilliant opportunities, but too much emphasis on heavy drinking and socials."

Sports centre could do with improvements Excellent, they are always there when you need them It's very detached.

The city is not vibrant enough! Wide range of clubs and beginning of year there is a clubs and societies fair thus helping to reach them"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,10 Feb 17,," It has been great. I have had the opportunity to meet people from a range of cultures and backgrounds. I have had the chance to be part of many wonderful societies like RAG, HistSoc and LawSoc and I have also found my course to be interesting. I think that uni has its ups and downs and I'm not saying everything will be perfect but on the whole I've had a great time and I'm still learning from it. Several of the societies such as law, finance and history make an active effort to run talks on different fields you can go into and give you advice on getting into that career. Several skills you gain through being part of a society are transferable in employment such as teamwork and organisation. The careers department are also very active running talks, workshops and one on one sessions. As well as the general careers adviser, each department has its own career adviser dedicated to your degree, e.g. a history careers adviser. The best thing about my lecturers is the range of lecturers I have. With history at Warwick, every single lecture has someone who is a specialist in the topic they're lecturing on. It's nice not to have the same lecturer all the time and it keeps the course interesting. I also like the wide range of optional modules that history has, it's also easy to do an outside option from another discipline if you see one you're interested in. There is a large amount of working space, the library itself is 5 floors. There is also the Rootes learning grid and university house, both of which are nice places to do some work. As a history student, I also find the modern records centre particularly useful, Warwick's very own archive! There's plenty of sports facilities too from the gym in the sports centre to courts if you want to play a game of badminton or tennis. Academic feedback is really good, it is often prompt and it's quite easy to see your tutor in their office hours or find one of your lecturers if there is something you don't understand or are worried about. Personal support I would say is also there, but you actually have to look for it to be able to make full use of it. If you know who to go to and who to ask for personal support then there's so much available to you The Student Union is really active. They run so many events ranging from socials like the famous weekly POP! all the way to advice on student housing. At Warwick, there are over 250 societies so there's a wide range of activities to choose from. You can also start your own society if you feel as though there isn't anything you're interested in. In my 1st year, I lived in halls. I was in Westwood and my room was spacious and had a sink. My flat was huge, there was 21 of us and there was a common room which meant we could socialise with other people too. Sharing showers and toilets wasn't an issue at all, not once did I have to wait and they were cleaned regularly. This year, I'm living in Leamington, we went through private housing and our landlord has been wonderful, any problem we've had he has been more than happy to fix. From what I read about Warwick's city life before coming here, I can say I've been pleasantly surprised. In first year, although it was a 10 minute bus drive from the nearest city Coventry, this wasn't really an issue as anything we needed was in reach. Fancied a coffee? We could go to the costa on campus or curiositea. Fancied a meal? We could go to one of the on campus restaurants like bar fusion. It's nothing like the city life of London, Manchester or Birmingham but it's definitely not as bad as I was made to think it was before coming here. If we ever do get tired of the Warwick bubble, we simply venture out a bit further to Birmingham which is 20 minutes on the train. There's a crazy amount of clubs and societies to choose from, over 250! There really is something for everyone and if you don't like anything on offer, there's the opportunity to create your own society!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat3,,rat1,rat1,Student Reviewer,04 Feb 17,Psychology BSc (Hons)," It's been very positive - good lecturers, good facilities and a generally good and supportive environment. I have enjoyed the brilliant library. Although I must say the campus is expensive when it comes to cafes and coffee bars. The careers department here is quite pro-active, they invite guest speakers who have used the same degree to come and speak, they offer careers advice about your given exit routes, CV writing and offer practice interviews. They provide plenty of opportunity to increase presentation skills and to work in teams to produce work. I think the diversity in knowledge and areas of specialist interest is high in this department and that I find facinateing Pretty good I think, we also have the added bonus of the brand new Oculus building, the Arts Centre and shops and bank within campus. Personally I think it is excellent. Very good academic support with personal tutors and approachable staff. I have used the counselling service and it's great, as is Nightline and the mental well being team I don't get involved very much, as I am a mature student with children and therefore don't get the time to really participate. Idk, I live in the country. Idk, as a mature student I haven't joined any"

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat3,,non_app,rat4,Student Reviewer,25 Jan 17,Psychology BSc (Hons)," My experience at Warwick uni has been amazing! I will be sad to leave this year and recommend it to any student who is after a brilliant uni that will provide you with a brilliant experience and education. Warwick holds careers fares regularly which provides students with the opportunity to meet people from various companies. There is also opportunities to meet with a careers advisor to discuss anything career related, such as getting help with writing your CV. Also I always get emails offering training in various skills, for example computer skills, that are very useful across any career. Psychology is a brilliant course! I'm in my third year now and have loved every year of it. My lecturers are all very engaging, enthusiastic and approachable and every lecture is interesting. My lectures are also recorded which is very useful if you miss a lecture and also when you go back to revise your lectures. The library is huge and you can almost always find a place to work. I tend to spend most of my time in there because it has quiet areas for when you want to get on with work but also has areas where you can sit with friends and talk, as well as having nice cafes within the library. There is also a supermarket on campus which has almost everything you might need but it is quite pricey. From my experience and from what I've heard from other people tutors are generally very helpful. In the past whenever I've had a problem with work my tutor has always been quick to respond with an answer/solution. Although I have not needed to use any counselling services, I am aware that there is counselling available to students and always see posters for Nightline which allows students to contact someone during the night if they have any issues. When I have used the SU it's good but I only tend to only go there for food or to play pool. I haven't really got involved this year though because of the workload that comes with being in third year. N/A I joined the belly dancing society, which is a lot of fun and is taught by both students and trained professionals for a cheap price. I would definitely recommend joining a society as it helps you to meet new people."
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat3,,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,25 Jan 17,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Enjoyable, I liked the people I've met and the knowledge I've gained. I have also enjoyed the increase in independence from school years as it has provided a new challenge Careers mentors and fairs Lecturers are accessible and easy to approach, modules are diverse Would rate an 8/10 but steadily improving Decent but could be better in terms of depth They seem to be very involved in making uni a better place Not as exciting as it could be Diverse"
rat2,rat2,rat2,rat5,rat2,,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat1,Student Reviewer,23 Jan 17,Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)," Ok, no ups or downs basically it's just like living at home it's from your not upset home you're at University and you put different people living with you and to be honest he will stop missing your family and all the good food but then you will settle into university life and sometimes you Fink you have too much free time and sometimes your stress but it's OK Good effort It's interning Very good Good Good Awful Awful Awful"

I like independent study and how approachable the lecturers are. You get cleaners for the communal areas of the accommodation. I like to go shopping and to the cinema in the city. The university facilities are really good and easily available. The library could be open 24hours. I joined the chess club, Warwick speakers, Biology society and ACS. The students' union is good but I would like to know more about what they do other than club nights. There's peer support by Biosol, tutorials and tutor meetings and nightline. I think getting a job will be very easy due to constant career events and support from career and skills."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology," I really love this university. I enjoy some of the modules I do and a few of my lecturers are really interesting. In terms of value, the accommodation is very overpriced for what you actually get but I love the majority of people I live with and the social aspect is great. The clubs in the city are good but there aren't that many. The facilities are mainly good. The gym is overpriced and the students' union isn't great either, they need to do more nights. I joined the pole dance club. I think it will be quite easy to get a job as long as I work hard to do well."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Maths and Physics," The university is pretty good. I would have enjoyed it more had I joined some clubs and societies earlier. Most lecturers make jokes with students in order to keep their attention. My accommodation was a big room, with internet and didn�t have to pay bills for 79 pounds. Good value. Leamington Spa is a nice, albeit small, city to go shopping. The immediate area around the university leaves a lot to be desired. All of the facilities are a short walk from each other and fairly modern. I joined the Arab society and the Boxing Club. I've never used the support services however most departments offer advice and help with careers. I don't think it will be easy to get a job but since Warwick is a good university, hopefully it'll be slightly easier."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Physics," The course incorporates a wide variety of physics into an interesting and engaging course. Generally the faci;ities are quite modern. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a space in the library, especially at 1pm. I've joined the Warwick student cinema; the sci-fi roleplaying and fantasy society; warwick comuting society. The food at the student union seems a little overpriced and it's difficult to find a place to sit at 1pm. Personal tutors help settle concerns with the course. on-campus clinic can settle medical concerns. Nightline is a service that allows you to drop-in and discuss personal concerns. Job prospects. Obviously it's a competitive market when considering job prospects. A recent employer event showed me how many options there are for graduates with a physics degree."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat3,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Business/Economics," The course has clear, structured lectures. The facilities are good but it needs a bigger library and study rooms. I have joined the WBS and economics society. Support is available from business school tutors and the undergraduate office."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology," It's been amazing, met some great people and have really enjoyed the experience. The topics covered on my course are really interesting. The student accommodation is really good value for money and really close to everything. The shopping is great, has great places to eat and very good night life. For facilities you have everything you need a maximum 10 minute walk from you. There are so many clubs and societies to choose from, I joined netball, psychology and Warwick ski and snowboard. The students' union has everything you need with a great club. For support there's nightline, tutors and mentors. I think Warwick work really hard to get their students a job."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Economics, There are very knowledgable lecturers on my course who are open to questions. The bad thing about my course is the large number of students. My accommodation in Leamington is expensive but very good quality housing. I enjoy shopping and eating out in the city. There car parking and library seats are needed. I have joined the ladies hockey club. There is counselling that supports students.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology, My course is interesting and my accommodation is beautiful and well maintained. I love shopping in the city centre. The uni facilities are good and the students' union is lively and helpful. There is NHS and insurance cover support.
rat3,rat5,rat3,rat2,rat3,,rat3,rat2,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Biomedical Sciences," Gibbet Hill is very basic. I enjoy my brain and behaviour lectures the most. My accommodation is very expensive. There isn't much to do in Coventry except to go to Kas Bar. There are mediocre sport facilities. I have joined the badminton, cricket, RAG, real ale and Hindu societies. Grants are given for support but that depends on household income."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology," In a bit of a 'bubble' on campus.The best things about my course is learning about the cognitive processes behind our actions and behaviours. I like the course content and the lecturers. There's lots of contact time with lecturers and academics. My accommodation is a long walk from some lectures. it's quite well priced. Very large rooms. A new bathroom but far away from my room. the city is far from the campus but the nightlife is good. Good sports facilities,could be better for some sports. New astroturf pitches are needed and closer changing rooms. Good academic facilities with a large library. Would be better if the library was open 24/7. I have joined the following clubs/societies - hockey,squash,RAGS and psychology. the students' union can be expensive but there are lots of events. There is nightline as a support. I think getting a job will be quite hard. I'm not sure what I want to do yet."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology, It's really fun here and less scary than I thought. I think it will be quite easy to get a job. There are lots of job guides and careers fairs to help. The best part of my course has been learning about the history behind psychology. My room is really big. I like to go out clubbing in the city. The uni facilities are really good. There could be a bit more space for the rowing ergs as the desso balcony is quite cramped. I have joined the rowing club. The student union is good. it's really convenient having a club on campus. You can get support from tutors.
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,26 Feb 15,Psychology," I love it but I'm very homesick. My course is interesting and applicable to everyday life. I think my job prospects are good but got to do PHD first. My accommodation is a long walk from campus but it's cheap. I like to shop in the city. The uni facilities are very good, particularly the restaurants. I've joined the following clubs/societies - psychology, Italian, mindaware and cinema. I love the student union and I work there. There's an advice centre and residential tutors for support."

rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," I've had an amazing time here so far, but the biggest let down is that Warwick is run like a business - often this corporate viewpoint overruns students own interests Been having difficulty with finding a job where there are so many more applicants than prospects Content is really interesting but some lectures are a let down - some too slow, some too fast. Loved my first year in a halls that was actually my fourth choice - it's the people! But the room was very generous and comfortable for the price and communal areas were kept tidy Lovely place but a bit sleepy Often hard to get a foot in - cliquey"
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,English Literature," I've never been happier, the campus is very homely and incredibly social. Being on a campus means everything you need is on your doorstep. The teaching is fantastic, the tutors are available and very helpful out of class time.

rat3,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Management," Warwick is one of the uni in UK which provides campus life so that you can easily feel the uni life unlike those they only have few buildings surrounded throughout different parts of the city. Although there are less city life and even need to pay huge amount of transportation fee to go to the city centre, but the refreshing atmosphere in the uni gives a good reason to study here."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History," Warwick is not for city lovers, but leamington has great charm and a much more chilled nightlife for lovers of pubs and bars"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,PPE," Warwick is great in terms of its Societies, general flair, friendliness and my course.

A lot of great facilities and study areas Great students union events lots of cheaper options and good quality too great night life The most societies in any UK university
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Maths & Physics," Great University, really enjoying my time here!"
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Engineering, Happy with the university Could introduce recorded lectures
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,BA in Politics and International Studies(1st year)," I chose 4 because of the reputation of the institution and the overall study environment it offers. A lot of firms do often come onto campus to exhibit and run events for students. There's however a very marginal presence of non profit organisations,civil society, volunteering and public sector organisations on campus. Lectures are very well organised, but seminars could be improved a bit more to make them more engaging and stimulating. The facilities are all of a good quality. Shuttle bus services, 24 hour study spaces and lecture recording services for some lectures are just a few of the many in thus category. Student academic support is highly inadequate but non academic support on the other hand is much better. The SU is great however it is too bureaucratic at the moment and could benefit from being more decentralised and informal in engaging with students l. The Warwick accommodation maintenance service does a very good job in responding quite swiftly to complaints and faults. The environment isn't too bad at all for a campus university. There's pretty much every other facility students will need in a city provided to a reasonable level. This ranges from a very modern arts centre featuring a galleries for exhibitions famous and upcoming artists, two cinemas and lots of restaurants. Clubs could improve by having more programmes for beginners and first years. The societies I'm part of are doing a relatively good job at the moment for their members."
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History," I do really enjoy my time at Warwick, however recently I have encountered a number of issues which I think should be addressed. Warwick hold a number of careers fairs and evening networking sessions and presentations from a huge number of businesses and law firms. This is excellent and praise the university for this. However, feel maybe the support for non-law students getting into law could be better, after being told to go to a CV workshop when they were all filled and then no more support regarding how to improve my CV, cover letters and answers for applications. Lectures vary in excellence, a basic handout would be good for each lecture to outline the basics for each theme. Some lecturers speak far too fast and fly through the lecture, others do not speak loud enough. In addition, the workload has been very intense with essays due most weeks on top of seminar reading and actual long essay deadlines due, still have no time to start them. Some seminars are interactive, very useful and enjoyable, other seminars are dull, tutor on his phone or does not appear to be listening to our presentations or set any reading which makes the seminar static and not always useful. Library needs a better stock of history books in quantity as the book you always want is already taken. In addition, would be good to have more of the recent historiography books. Sometimes do not feel I can approach module tutors and discuss concerns with essays and modules. Some tutors are excellent and very quick at responding to emails, others take a week. Marking essays has become slower, taking over a month to get essay feedback which is concerning when trying to write long essays based from short essays. SU is quite small and only circle/Pop is a good night on wednesday. Would be great to create some more SU nights. Fresher halls were excellent.Uni off campus accommodation good/ok - when first arrived the shower was broken, hot water would not reach the third floor, broken oven. However, the rooms are large and have a enough desk space to work and comfy double bed. Difficult not living in a city there is not very much going on in Leamington Spa. Would be great to have some more places to go out, bars but also chill areas, daytime activities. I play for the ladies hockey club, great people and made lots of friends, plenty of socials as well as fitness, training and matches. I am part of the law society, would be nice if they could include and create more activities for non-law students to feel more included and have a better understanding of the GDL process and funding as well as securing vacation scheme placements and training contracts."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Politics," I have had few problems with the University itself, the main issues are expense (travel costs, etc) and finding like-minded people to make things easier. Easier than at other Universities, but still difficult. The flexibility allows me to study in a way which suits me well and would enable others to do the same despite differences, plus any resource is openly available to me. Mostly good, particularly in terms of flat maintenance. The distance between the nearest town and the University makes some facilities difficult to access. Personal Tutors provide good support academically, nightline is in place and there is a good counselling service. Good range of activities both night time and daytime, easily accessible if you have problems, sometimes a little expensive. Although I pay more than most for my University accommodation, I believe that none of it is below par and it caters to people's options. In the summer months I like going to the parks, I also enjoy the markets that sometimes visit and how readily available the shops and facilities are. Northern society, Harry Potter society, Cheese and Chocolate society, Craft society"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Computer Science MEng (Hons)," I love it. Could always be better but a good university with a pleasant campus. I am quite happy with the 100% graduate employment rate for my course for the year previous to my joining the university, I like the fact that I get to do a lot of practical work (programming). Facilities are generally very good except the price of sports clubs and gym membership is quite expensive and had a sharp rise in cost this year. I have had a very positive experience with university support services. The university runs nightline and has a student counselling service. Good value SU outlets and enjoyable events. Could be slightly cheaper but not bad. The rooms were really clean and neutral. The kitchens were really very nice and had excellent toasters (Dulat ones)! Accommodation is (mostly) close to everything you need on campus. Not a city based university. The campus is nice. Living in Leamington in second year is very nice except getting the bus in is a pain. More societies than you could ever want. Brilliant to have such a wide range of activities to do."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History and Sociology BA (Hons), I really enjoy my time at Warwick. I believe it lives up to its reputation.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat2,rat3,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,History and Poliics," I really like University of warwick and would recommend it t new students. I really like my course, the content is great and the work amount is well balanced. A little minus in the lack of communication between departments. The library is excelent, the union building is good and the sports facilites are extensive. i haven i think that they probably are doing a good job, but their administration is a complete mess. Fine, but I really hate floor carpets! When you are living on campus you rarely see anything that even resembles a city. Ive been able to join several very good societies."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,24 Feb 15,Biomedical Science," I think that over all, Warwick Isaac really good uni. The accomodation is ok but I would recommend campus accomodation for 1st year over off-campus. The teaching is amazing but challenging and I look forward to completing my degree"
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Business with Marketing (MSc)," Living campus ! Many opportunities (careers fairs, societies, sport facilities). International environment notably in the Business School department. There are also many places where you can work (learning grid, library). The atmosphere is very positive. Numerous cafés and restaurants on campus (curiosities, costa, xananas...) "
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Law LLB (Hons)," Good experience, especially as an international student. The fact that the university is campus-based helps tremendously in fostering a sense of community. However, it is important to note that it is important to be proactive in making the most of your time at university, because your experience is defined and shaped by you."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,French and History BA (Hons)," Warwick is great! The only thing is accommodation is fairly expensive, despite opting for the shorter let. There's not really much 'city life', but I suppose you can go out for the evening in Leamington/Coventry. The uni facilities are amazing, and there's e-books available online for free for key texts which is a great help with essays. I've joined aerobics, history and french which have all been really enjoyable. The SU is great for going out and meeting new people, especially in freshers (fresher's party etc..). I haven't really used the support services, but there's a lot of career services so I think job prospects will be quite good upon leaving. Overall, Warwick is a lot of fun, and allows you to keep a good work/life balance if you are good at time management!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Finance," There's lots of new things to learn on my course, and it builds nicely on my undergraduate education. It's also helpful for practical fields. The accommodation is very comfortable, safe and can be lively. The city centre of Coventry has some things you can do like shopping. In terms of facilities, I wish there were more locker facilties on campus, but other than that very good. I've joined the finance society and Warwick volunteers and it's been a good way to meet people. The SU is nice and modern, and there are support services like nightline and tutors. Overall, I like it a lot. Lots of nice people and the campus has a really nice feel to it."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History," There's a wide range of topics and interesting lectures on my course. The accommodation is in a brilliant location on campus and is nice inside. I like to go shopping and clubbing in the city. The gym and pool are lovely and the academic facilities such as the learning grid are good. I've joined drama and history societies which are great. The SU has a good range of places to eat and drink as well as chill out and support areas. There is also an excellent careers service and student support line. I think warwick encourage us to start thinking about careers early, so I think that job prospects will be good. Overall, it's been fantastic!"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat1,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History of Art," There's only 10 hours of contact time on my course. The accommodation is a bit boring but really lovely and clean most of the time and there's an en-suite which I love. Not much city life. Birmingham is great but quite far away. In terms of facilities, the library is great but costcutter doesn't cut costs! far too expensive. I've joined the warwick student cinema which I love. The SU is great but the club is awful. I've never been informed about any support services but sub-wardens are great. I can't really be sure about employability. Hopefully it should be good though. Overall, warwick is pretty ok."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History," There's a really wide variety of lectures and topics, and many different topics available to study. The accommodation includes good facilities, it's clean, great location/central and on campus. I've enjoyed going out in Leamington and Coventry in the evenings and also shopping. The uni has good facilities, especially the library, learning grid and gym. I've joined History society and cheese & chocolate which have been really fun. The SU is very good, and there's great careers services on offer. In turn, this makes job prospects at this university very good in my opinion. Overall, the university is excellent. Defintely think long and hard about both your course and your accommodation preference!"
rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Management," There's a range of subjects on my course but it's not particularly stimulating and is a lot of work. The accommodation is great, close to everything, good sized rooms and kitchens and the people are really nice. My favourite thing to do in the nearby cities is to go for nights out. Uni facilities are great, although the sports facilities could be cheaper to use. I've joined management and marketing societies and enjoy them. The SU is good but the range of events could be improved. There's a good range of support services like nightline. I feel like job propsects will be difficult but possible. Overall the university of very good. I would recomend it to others."
rat5,rat5,rat1,rat5,rat2,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Accounting and Finance," There is literally nothing good about my course. It's boring and utterly pointless so far. The accommodation is good value at �20 per night. The en-suite is a plus, and there are cleaners. City life? Leam is nice, Coventry is awful. There are great sport facilities, and the library is very good too. Campus is generally well-maintained. I play football and it's great for socials. I'm very indifferent towards the SU. I don;t really know what it is they do. I've never used the support services so can;t really commment on these. I feel like the uni has good city connections especially for banking. Not sure about other jobs... Overall, I've enjoyed it so far but it's still early days. Wish my course was better..."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Marketting and Strategy," There are lots of group discussions and case studies in my course which is really good. The accommodation I'm staying in is quite big, modern, clean and quiet which is all good. There's not really a city, but you can get the bus to some good shopping places. The uni facilties are quite good and close together. I am involved with Warwick volunterring which has been great. The SU has everything you need and is fairly ok. With support services, you have career services. As far as job prospects go, I do not have much confidence at the moment! Overall though I have had a good time so far and am looking forward to the rest of the year at warwick."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Classical Civilisation," There are lots of different aspects to my course and it involves learning a wide range of material. The accommodation has a good layout and reasonable overall price due to 30 week let. There's not really any city life to be honest. There's some good facilities, including the arts centre and warwick sport. There are a wide range of societies to choose from. The SU is great, lots of things to do and good at helping with stuff. Support is also good. Access to academic and personal support- very accessible. I also think that my degree will be good at helping me get a job. Overall, very enjoyable. I've had a facilitated transition into uni life."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Chemistry," The teachers are all really friendly and helpful when you have a problem, and the courses have lots of content. Accommodation is really warm and excellently maintained. I haven't had any real experience of the city life but I know it's there if I want to branch out of campus. The facilities are pretty good, however some facilities are too expensive (i.e. warwick sport). I've joined clubs like salsa and aerobics, and they've been fun so far. In terms of the SU, I hate clubbing... otherwise it's great. There's lots of support services, i.e. mentors, tutor, disability support. Hopefully job prospects will be pretty easy as warwick is well reputed. Overall, It's been fabulous! I love it here! :)"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History," The lectures I've found to be enjoyable and interesting, and all the lecturers seem passionate about what they do. I'm really happy with my accommodation as it's nice and spacious but it is a bit expensive. There's not a lot ot do in Coventry but access is easy and the services to Birmingham aren't that expensive which helps! There's access to everything we could need on campus and bus services into town are easy. The gym is nice and classes are great but membership is a bit pricey. I have joined Warwick Devils cheerleading which was a great way to meet new like-minded people. The SU is ok but can get very repetitive. I haven't really used the support services to be honest, but I feel like the careers services make job prospects easy. Overall, I am really enjoying Warwick. It's easy to keep a work/life balance if you're motivated!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Politics," The lectures are straight to the point and coincide with the seminars. The seminars are very interactive in a setting that encourages student to participate not only by reading the course material but by interacting with other students. The seminars help individuals connect with their course mates who often share similar interests. Clubs and societies are a very unique aspect of the Warwick University lifestyle and are a great way to become more involved on campus. They not only get students involved in an activity or social environment that they enjoy but also enable the students to meet new people while doing so. Overall, I've liked it a lot so far. I'm only here for 1 term but I feel like I've settled in really well. Make sure you go to Kasbah in Coventry. It's the best nightclub in the area for a decent night out!!"
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," What to say about Warwick� It has some absolutely great points and some not so great! Great points include the University facilities, such as the gym and the library/learning grid/rootes grid. The accommodation, although expensive, is really nice and close to everything. There are also enough clubs and societies to cater to everyone's needs and ensure you are never bored. Not so great points; I feel like it's expensive compared to other universities. Costcutter is far too expensive for what it is, the gym is expensive and accommodation is expensive. The SU is great for night out, but again, although there are some drinks deals they could definitely be cheaper (it is exclusively a student bar after all). Overall though, I'm having a lot of fun, and am looking forward to the rest of the year."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Management," The opportunities and flexibility offered by my course. My accommodation is very sociable and I have loads of amazing flatmates. I've joined clubs such as skydiving and rugby which are both great. The SU is good most nights, and the facilities mean you can do a lot of things right there on the campus. The only downside is that it is not a city uni, so you have to get a bus or taxi for a night out. Other than that, it's been great!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Law," Warwick's been a really good uni to gain an understanding of the law at due to the high quality of teaching and the academic facilities. There's a lot of interesting courses to pick from. Accommodation is of a really high standard although it's often wuite expensive. The facilities are excellent. If I had any complaints, it would be that constcutter is incredibly expensive for a student shop. There's loads of interesting and unique clubs to join. I've joined the law society. The SU is ok but the club is abit rubbish if I'm honest. It can be good with the right people though. I haven;t heard about support services, but hopefully with all the careers support job hunting should be ok. Overall, Warwick is an amazing uni for anyone. It has so much to offer and there's really not anything I have to complain about other than the cost of certain ammenities."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," There's a good choice of optional modules on my course although politics is more theoretical than I thought. Economics modules are great as the lectures are so good. Accommodation; big kitchen, en-suite, but depends on who your flat-mates are (some flats are more sociable than others). There's no washing machines in residences. Coventry is depressing, but Leamington is a good night out. The library is excellent, campus is great and there's always lots to do. However the sports facilities, while excellent, are very expensive. I've joined WFS, and it's good. The SU is great, with many activities planned throughout the year. Support services are ok, including nightline etc.. There are lots of career presentations and internship advice so I think job prospects will be pretty good. Overall, there's lots of great people, and lots of great societies to get involved in. Love it!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," My course has some really good lecturers who manage to make some dry topics quite interesting. The workload is quite a lot, but if you keep on top of it then it's ok. Accommodation is great. Some really cool people, nice rooms and central location. There are some good things to do in the city like clubs/bars. The facilities are excellent. The gym and learning grids in particular are stand-out. There's a lot of clubs and societies to pick from as well as sports. The SU is pretty good on occassion, although they need to do more to get people in the club on friday's and saturdays. Haven't really used the support services but I'm sure they're fine. Hopefully I'll get a job at some point! Overall, it's been great, really nice place with lots of cool things to do!"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English and German BA (Hons)," My course is challenging and thought-provoking. We're encouraged to think critically and apply a wide range of theories to texts and films, not just accept received wisdom on certain topics. We cover traditional and contemporary texts and seminars are well-led, however we receive little advice or feedback on essay writing and there is less choice for joint honours students as we have more compulsory modules than other straight English Lit students."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Computer Science," My course is quality. Excellent teachers and really interesting material. Glad I chose it. The accommodation is great. Really nice kitchen which is great for socials and gets cleaned regularly. My favourite thing to do in nearby Coventry is go to Nandos. The uni facilities are really good. Everything seems nice and modern. There's lots of places to work socially or work quietly. There's plenty of clubs and societies to choose from. The SU is excellent. Good bars and good club. There's copious support services although I haven't really used them. Hopefully, getting a job at the end of my degree should be easy. Overall, it's a really nice uni. Definitely looking forward to my time here. Made some excellent friends already!!!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Law and Business," My course is really good. I like that I can do a mixture of both law and business modules because it adds some variety and some perspective. Accommodation is great but there's no laundry facilities inside! People are really friendly though. Leamingotn has really good nightlife and shopping. There's great library facilities and sports stuff. I've joined WFS which offers great socials and work opportunities. In the SU, the nightlife is exactly the same every week, would be good if they mixed it up every now and then. Nighlint is apparently a great support service although I've never personally used it. There are also great facilities to help better your skills and your CV. Overall, I'd give warwick a 4. There's room for improvement but it's pretty great generally speaking."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Computer Science," My course offers lots of new challenges, theories and information which exites me. Programming in a new language has been fun. Accommodation is very nice! It feels homely. It's good value. The only issue is the fridge is too small. I haven't really needed to venture into the city as campus has everything! The facilities are really good, especially the climbing centre! I've joined climbing and computing and I love them! The SU has a large selection of things to do, and they've been helpful with problems I've had. I haven't really needed the support services really. In terms of job prospects, the amount of careers emails and information I've had is outstanding. I should have many options. Overall, I really like my course, the people, and the campus atmosphere."
rat3,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Philosophy," My subject is really interesting in terms of material and topics. My accommodation is good value, not the most expensive but could be slightly cheaper. There's good clubs in Leamington and Coventry. There's good educational facilities and the student's union is generally good. I've joined societies such as philosophy and law. There's a good range of options. The SU has good options for food but club nights good be improved. There's support services on offer such as nightline and tutors. I don't think job prospects will be easy, but certainly easier than if I hadn't come to uni. Overall I'm really enjoying it, there's a great atmosphere and people are nice."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Modern Languages BA (Hons), Really good lecturers and teachers. Good number of contact hours and I like the small class sizes. Great sized room and kitchen/lounge area. More than enough space and ot paying for christmas and easter works out cheaper. There's no city although Birmingham is great. More shops could be on campus and costcutter is overpriced. I've joined German society which I love. The SU is really good overall. There's a lot of support available should you need it. I haven't been informed about careers specific to my degree but speaking 4 languages makes me quite sure I'm employable. Staff are all really kind and helpful. It's a lot of work and sometimes difficult to find a balance but overall I like it.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," Supervisions are very helpful and allow us to discuss assignments with eachother. Everyone in the accommodation is friendly, and there are people on hand to deal with any issues. The best thing to do in the nearby cities is definitely going out at night. In terms of facilities, everything is great so far. It's all nearby and well put together. I've joined maths society and it's really helpful to classes. The SU is great, I have no complaints about it! Supervisors and personal tutors are always available to offer support if needed. Warwick has an excellent reputation for teaching maths so hopefully job-hunting should be ok. Overall, I've settled in well and am really enjoying my time here so far."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Psychology," That a lot of the lectures are timetabled so that they are early in the morning, so I am finished in the afternoon. We get a lot of support from our tutors and lecturers are willing to help out. Accommodation is really nice and spacious. We have a lot of facilities aswell, including washing facilities which are easy to use. Leamington is nice for social events and shopping. In terms of clubs and societies, there's a huge range of things to do and they halp you settle in and form friends. The SU is easy to get to and there's always something on. I feel well supported by the support services, and always get emails about job prospects."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat2,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Psychology," The best thigs about my course are the professors and the exposure to new ideas. The accomodation is pretty decent. Although, the cleaners can be very rude and not helpful! The best thing I like to do in the city is to go clubbing! Facilities that could be improved include the campus restaurants, the SU and the laundry rooms. I've joined psychology and Indian society and would recommend both. The terrace bar at the SU is great. Support services are good. There's a helpline for when you're lonely and MyAdvantage careers help. Hopefully getting a job should be easy! Overall, my experience has been fun and educative. Defintely glad I chose Warwick, although it is a lot of work!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,French and Spanish," The best thing about my course has been a year abroad and good job propsects. Tutors and lecturers are all very helpful. Arthur Vick is excellent. Very clean, lovely layout and facilities are brilliant. I like shopping in the city because there's lots of choice. The uni facilties are brilliant and very modern. I've joined Yoga, RAG and french societies and they've all been great. The SU is usually very informative, and support services include a residential and personal tutor. Hopefully job prospects will be fairly good as my degree is quite broad. Overall, I'm loving uni life so far!"
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat1,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,"Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics (MORSE) MMorse"," The best thing about my course is the high earning jobs at the end of it! My accommodation is nice and generally good value (except the cleaners are not great and can be very rude!) The best things to do in the city are shopping and clubbing. In terms of facilities, there are good sports, bad restaurants and overall cheaper student deals would be good. I've joined MORSE, finance and swimming club, all great! The SU is really good, I really like the pool room! Could be more variety of events though. Support services aren't great, wardens are never up for helping out with anything. I think getting a job will be easy once I've left! Overall, I would describe warwick as sociable, hard-working, busy and fun."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Engineering," The best thing about my course is the structure and the interesting lectures. My accommodation en-suite and pretty good value for money I think. The best thing to do in the city is definitely clubbing (Kasbah!). The facilities and campus in general are really pretty. However, a better SU is needed. I've joined cocktail and engineering societies and they've been a great way of meeting new people. The Student's Union club is frequently dead. There needs to be something that will draw people there like better events and cheaper drinks. There's good support groups in the form of mentoring and tutor groups. Hopefully getting a job should be pretty easy coming from warwick. Depends on the job though I suppose. Overall, it's been amazing! The people are great and we've had a lot of fun as a flat!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Cyber Security and Management," The course is great although it's a full time masters course so a lot of work! I haven't really had much time to go on nights out etc� The accommodation is really nice and spacious but a little bit quiet. I'm in lakeside, but in postgrad accommodation so maybe quietness is to be expected. I haven't really had time to branch out into the city yet, but I here leamington spa is quite nice. The facilities are pretty good. The campus is nice all round actually. I haven't joined clubs/societies but I'm aware there is a lot of choice if you have the spare time. I like the SU, it's fairly modern and has some good places to get food, although costcutter is way overpriced. I haven't really heard much about 'support services'. I think it will be fairly easy to get a job after leaving Warwick. The university has a great reputation. Overall, I don't have many complaints about Warwick. Being so busy, I feel like I haven't quite got the chance to take advantage of all the great things the university has to offer!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Innovation and Entrepreneurship," The course is well managed with good two-way communication. There's also a lot of student actitivities involved. The accommodation has a calm atmosphere with good cleaning facilities. There's good shopping in Leamington and Coventry. The overall facilities are very nice but the wifi facility in rooms/kitchens neds to be improved as it keeps disconnecting every two minutes. I'm involved with a lot of warwick sports. Also, the SU is very cooperative and helpful. Support services: library access to portals, sports facilities, food spots, bars. Job propects are very easy due to good student fairs. Overall, the experience is very nice."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Maths and Stats," The course really makes you fully immerse yourself in mathematics, which could be good or bad depending on the person. The accommodation is very good value, very clean, and I was given all the essentials prior to moving in i.e. duvet, chair, desk, bookshelf etc.. The uni facilities are very good, especially the study areas like the rootes grid.I've joined several clubs including WFS, chess, maths and consulting. The SU are awesome. They've done a great job in organising study/social events. We're given supervisors to help us understand topics we struggle on which is helpful. These are 4th year maths students. Job prospects should be fairly good. Warwick has a good reputation and offers great careers services. Overall, work is very hard, but is also very interesting. People are very nice. Campus is very clean and big, and there's lots of open spaces to play frisbee."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Marketting and Strategy," The course structure is excellent (I am doing a masters). The accommodation is a comfortable and safe setting. My favourite thing to do in the city is to go for dinners with friends. The university has many great facilities, including a good gym and running track. I've joined Indian society, there's something for everyone! Overall, it's been a very engaging experience. I'll be sad to be leaving when my course finishes!"
rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat2,,rat2,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,P.A.I.S.," The courses are ok but could be better! Some of it is verrrrry boring! My accommodation is Jack Martin and I really like it. Nice rooms and nice kitchens. There is nothing to do in the cities. Don't bother venturing out there unless you�re going to a nightclub. The uni facilities are good, they really take care of the students. There's so many clubs and societies! Yah! The Student's Union is ok, the club could play better music... Support services? Never heard of them! I think job prospects will be ok aswell, lots of career related support. Overall, Warwick is a really great experience. I'm an exchange student from Canada!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Biochemstry," The fact that my course has really good facilities, such as labs. Other facilities also feel really new and everything looks nice. People here also seem to be really friendly. Support services are good, and tutors are really helpful outside of lectures. The Uni has good contact with companies so I feel that job prospects will be good. The only things I could note for improvement are the SU events, which can be boring, and the accommodation could be better value (although it is nice)."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Computer Science," The lecturers are all awesome and explain things really well. Get an en-suite and it's cheaper than Bluebell, sherbourne and heronbank! I love clubbing in Leamington! Facilities: Excellent labs, nothing could really be improved if I'm totally honest. Clubs and societies; I've joined CMD, Japan soc, student cinema, computing and game design. The SU holds excellent events that are on every single night. I've never used nightline but it seems like an amazing service from what I've heard. Job prospects; Employers are always coming to Warwick to give talks/hold events which makes me think they like the uni. Overall, I've made amazing friends and have loved every minute of it so far!"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," The lecturers are great, and everyone on the course is really smart and friendly so you can turn to others for help if you want. Other accommodations are very expensive. Ours has a good kitchen and nice rooms so it's worth it. Coventry is not a nice place but Leamington is quite nice. The facilities are expensive but really nice quality in general. There are loads of societies and sports to get involved with. I've joned Lacrosse and love it. Nights at the SU are pretty average but can be ok. I haven't used the support services, but I think it terms of careers warwick is well regarded so getting a job should be fairly easy. Overall, I've had no problems so far. It's been fairly decent."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," The lecturers on my course are really good and there's always plenty of work to do. The kitchens and rooms in Jack Martin are a good size and I have an en-suite. Coventry and Leamington are great for shopping, bars and clubs, but it's far away. Coventry costs �15 in a taxi. The library, lecture theatres and sports facilities are all really good. Warwick jailbreak was an amazing experience and would reccommend it to everyone. The SU is really good and really helpful. I have a supervisor class twice a week, specific module classes twice a week and a tutor group meeting roughly once every two weeks. Support is fantastic. There have also been loads of careers fairs that I've found really helpful. Overall, my experience so far at warwick has been great. Looking forward to the next few years."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," The content of my course is really interesting and the lecturers seem to genuinely care about every student. The accommodation is good value for money, but fault reports are never dealt with! Nearby cities coventry and leamington are good for both clubbing and going out to eat at restaurants. The uni has very good facilities, and has everything you need. However, the prices in costcutter are NOT student friendly which has a severe impact on budget. I've joined Hindu and Maths societies which have been awesome so far. The SU is ok, but events are repetitive and a bit uninspiring. There's good academic support and the residential team are really helpful. Job prospects can be really good, just depends how hard you work! Overall, warwick has a great campus atmosphere, and I'm really enjoying my time here and university life in general."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Innovation and Entrepreneurship," The course study is practical, and the accomodation is both quiet and good. There's nice people around here, although the geese sometimes wake you up early!! Leamington is a nearby town where it's good to party. The uni facilities are good but could definitely be cheaper. I've joined Indian society which is really fun. If you come to warwick, make sure you think long and hard about what kind of experience you want to have, and in turn, what accommodation you will choose. Nothing will have a bigger impact upon your freindship group and your time here. If you like loud nights and parties, go to rootes or jack martin. If you want a more peaceful experience, stick to lakeside, heronbank or arthur vick."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Physics," The lecturers give out free chocolate to question answers which is good! The accommodation is great, big kitchen, bean bags, cleaners come twice a week, it's good. The city is not great� clubs suck and I'm fairly certain I'll get stabbed. In terms of facilities, there's lots to do but they're overpriced! The squash club is good and with all the societies there's lots going on. The SU's tries god bless 'em! but the club is bad... Support is good, physics have career advisors. I'm not sure about job prospects but I guess they'll be pretty good. Overall I'll give warwick a 4 out of 5. It would be more if it was cheaper and the clubs were better."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat2,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mechanical Engineering," My course has high contact hours which I like. My accommodation is ok but seems really expensive compared to other universities. Warwick is a campus, so city life is virtually non-existent although you can get a bus to Leamington/Coventry. Facilities are great, although an improvement could be to make the lecture seats more comfortable! There are quite a few good bars in the student's union which means there's always somewhere to go. There's also lots of support services. I also feel like it will be quite easy to get into a job once I leave university due to a good track record. Overall, I'd reccommend my uni because of the facilities, the people and the course."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," My course has a lot of really great lecturers that make the topics engaging. My accommodation is great and has a nice room. Luckily I really like my flatmates! It's a bit expensive though. City life summed up; Coventry is bad, Leamington is good. In terms of facilities, the library is good but laundry services could be better. I've joined WFS and its great for getting work opportunities. I like the SU, every event is good, although they are all very similar. Nightline is a good support service although I haven't used it. Hopefully job prospects will be good, and I can get a job off the back of an internship. Overall, it's been really good fun and there's lots of great people here!"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat2,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Chemistry," Most lecturers are alright and kind of wacky but labs suck and the early morning are rubbish too. Accommodation is amazing, with a kitchen/common room, ensuite, good sized bedrooms and being close to campus. There isn't much city life, but the facilities are great. The library is amazing and we have a relatively good student union althouhg the clubbing is rubbish. Societies are good. I've joined trampolining and salsa. We have good bars/pubs but need more fast food places! also, costcutter does not cut costs at all. In terms of support services, I'm not sure... but sub-wardens are ok. Warwick also provides a lot of support in terms of career help. Overall it's a nice campus but there's not much to do. Also there's no McDonald's nearby..."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," Teaching quality is very high and there are some really interesting modules to pick from. Accommodation seems quite expensive for campus, and there's little fridge space. It's a good location though and is a lot of fun. I haven�t been to the city so can't comment on that. Sports facilities are really good, as are lecture facilities and the IT/wifi. I've joined Economics, finance and marketting societies, all of which have been great. There are lots of opportunities to try out a variety of new activities at the SU. I haven;t been to any support services but I think there is quite a lot of pastoral support. I think employment will be relatively easy as the uni seems to prepare you well. Overall it's been very good. Lots of opportunities. Made new friends. Teaching is a very high standard."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Business (Finance and Accounting)," My course is very interactive, and there's good communication. Accomodation is very nice if not a little on the expensive side. The city is ok for shopping and eating out. The uni facilities are great, and although I haven't joined any sports, there's loads of other stuff to do (gym etc...). The SU is awesome, although the club could be cheaper. I haven't really had to use the support service but I am aware that they are there if I need them. I feel like getting a job should be pretty easy after leaving Warwick. It's been awesome overall and I hope it continues to be the same way."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Engineering," My course has really high contact hours which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it. The accommodation is generally quite good, except that the windows don't open and the rooms are dusty. Coventry is good at night but not so much during the day. Leamington is pretty good all round. The uni facilities are really good. The only problem is that there's no chip shop?!? Where am I supposed to get my chips after a night out! outrageous! I've joined engineering society which has actually been quite helpful for my course. The SU is ok as a venue but the night are terrible and the music is bad. Not sure about support services, I havent used them. Equally, I'm only in first year so not too sure about job prospects but hopefully good! Overall, I really like Warwick. It has the right balance of work and fun. Glad I put it as my first choice."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Management," Lectures are very thourough and small seminar groups with a great student/teacher ratio make it easier to contribute in class discussions. There's also interesting modules. Accommodation is great value for money! There's a good number of flatmates for 1 kitchen and everything is included in the price. There's good places to eat and shop in nearby towns. Uni facilities such as the gym and the arts centre are great.There's a huge variety of societies on campus, with lots of opportunities to get involved as freshers. There's lots of interesting events at the SU, and there's careers and skills support aswell. Job prospects; there are some great societies such as WFS that help you in searching for a career. Overall it's been a great experience, and freshers was really good!"
rat5,rat5,rat2,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Biological Sciences," Lecture topics are very dry and boring. The course is very focussed on molecular biology. The accommodation gives adequate room and has good facilities and is well heated. The nearest city is Coventry and there's no life there. The facilities are good but the gym needs to be expanded. I've joined Athletics and swimming which are both good. The SU has good facilities but not much variety. The university provides good services for career development and CV writing. Overall, the experience has been good."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,"Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics (MORSE) MMorse"," I've enjoyed finding out how maths can be used in the real world. Accommodtion includes lots of a good facilitie, everything gets cleaned often but it does need some repair work. The sports facilities are really good and so are the arts facilities. If you are interested in something, the facilities will be here. I've joined jailbreak, football and rugby and it's been a lot of fun. The SU holds great events but they close too early. In terms of support I know if I ever need anything there will be someone I can talk to. Hopefully getting a job will be veyr easy. There are lots of careers fairs in which I've got a lot of information. Overall warwick has been simply amazing!"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Management," Lectures aren't too cramped, and there's enough time to study and have fun. Modules are interesting, seminars help a lot, especially when you don't understand lectures. I'm staying in Sherbourne and it's very modern and nice. Rooms are clean and kitchens have a lot of space. Good for socialising. Coventry and Leamington are the two places we often visit. Clubs like smack and neon are quite nice. The sports facilities are really good and modern. More supermarkets for people who live in further away halls would be good. I've joined WFS and it's great. The SU is good and helpful, although food queueing in restaurants could be improved. Personal tutors give good support and WBS is highly reputable as far as job prospects go. Overall, the university is awesome!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Management," Lectures are really interesting and interactive to attend. I got my first accommodation preference and have had no problems so far. There's not much city life, but the campus facilities are good and most things can be found nearby. I've joined Warwick Debating Society and the Indian society which I enjoy. Careers support has been great regarding any career information, so I feel like I'm in a good position as far as job prospects go. Overall, I'd say it was a great uni. There are some really nice places to eat (like varsity) and people are really friendly including lecturors and tutors. Definitely get involved with some fun extra-curricular activities if you get the chance."
rat3,rat3,rat2,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Marketting and Strategy," Lectures are good as they involve a lot of case studies. Living in lakeside is good because it's quiet and makes it easy for me to study. I like to go to the city to do things like watch plays. Uni facilities are good, especially the frequent shuttle services. I've joined the swimming club which has been good so far. The Student Union is good although there could be more events for people who dont like to drink too much! I feel like job prospects are quite good for me as Warwick has a good name in India. Overall, it's been brilliant. I can't wait to spend the rest of the academic year here, and hope for more of the same."
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," Lecturers are enthusiastic about their subjects. For the price we pay, our accommodation is good. The location is definitely the best part. The best part about the nearby town is the club 'smack'. In terms of facilities, the library is really good and the learning grid. The layout was well thought out. I've joined economics soc, finance and rugby. Love it! The SU is ok, but the music in the club isnt that great most of the time and often it's way too empty. Support services include; nightline, personal tutors and residential tutors. I think getting a job will be easy with all the extra stuff we're expected to do. Overall, it's pretty good. It's got the balance right between work and recreation!!!!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English and German BA (Hons)," I've really enjoyed my time at Warwick. My course has been interesting and enjoyable, as well as challenging at times, and I think the campus has a great community feeling. My only criticism would be the high costs of facilities, such as on-campus accomodation and sports memberships. My course has been really good and offers a lot of scope for module choices and methods of asessment. Everything's also really close together being a campus uni, and all the people are really freindly. There's rarely a dull moment and I've enjoyed every second of it!!!!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Law," I've loved Warwick! My course is interesting and stimulating although sometimes it can be a lot of work! I am not off campus but the accommodation in Leamington Spa is fine, and it's great being in a town where lots of students live. The city life is ok but could be better in terms of the nightclubs. Facilities are excellent. The library has everything and the sports facilities are amazing albeit expensive. There's loads of clubs and societies to choose from so everyone will be happy. The SU is ok although I haven't really been there in a while. Again, I haven't used the support services although I know they are there if I need them. I have no idea of about job propsects! Hopefully good! Overall, it's been great. There'e a lot of interesting people here and the teaching standard is fantastic, particularly for law. 10/10!!"
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,rat4,,rat2,rat3,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History and Sociology BA (Hons)," I've enjoyed the independent reading that my course offers. Accommodation includes good en-suite facilities and there is lots of nightlife in the nearby towns and cities. The uni facilities are good in terms of academics, but the SU events are not fun! The uni is so good for societies, I've joined many academic ones. The SU is good for support services but nights out aren't great. There are also support services like nightline and the undergraduate office. Also, job prospects seem better here than at other unis!"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," I've enjoyed the fact that there are no registers taken in lectures, so it's easy to skip lectures. All accommodation facilities are good. Decent sized rooms, and a 30 week rent perios is cheaper. There's not much to do in the city to be honest. The facilities are good. Could be improved by making things cheaper! I haven't joined any societies, but the SU put on decent events most nights. I haven't needed any support services, but I hear warwick is pretty good for careers services so job propsects are good. Overall it's been good. lots of work and very little sleep!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English & German lit," I think that overall, the support network that Warwick offers is to be comended. I have also thoroughly enjoyed my course throughout my time here. My only complaint would be the seeming drive towards profit over student satisfaction - the sharp rise in costs of sports associations and accommodation is something I find difficult for them to justify. Overall though, I've really enjoyed Warwick. I've met a lot of great people and learned a lot from my course. I would definitely reccommend my course and my university to others considering it as an option."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," Interesting range of topics but could have a few more contact hours on my course. The accommodation is in a perfact position and I've been put with a great group of people. The best thing to do in nearby Coventry is definitely to go to Kasbah! If I could name some improvements for university facilities, I would say, make it easier to get SU event tickets and also a better stocked library. I've joined football and squash, and am loving them both. The SU offers a pretty good range of events, can't complain. In terms of support, there's lots of career information, but it could be channeled through one easy channel rather than loads of different ones. Hopefully getting a job will be quite easy. Overall, I'm really enjoying the course and uni life in general."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Chemistry," I like my course as it teaches us from the basics to the advanced at a steady pace. Accommodation is good value as I have an en-suite and a large kitchen. Also, it's really close to the centre of campus. City life is ok if you�re willing to venture out a bit. Facilities are very good, especially the labs. Maybe there could be cheaper food outlets? I've joined football and chemistry society and I am enjoying both. The SU organises regular daily events so that's good. They're also really good at notifying us about weekly updates. Support is good. If anything goes wrong, there are a lot of different people I can talk to about it depending on the circumstances. I don't think getting a job will be 'easy' but warwick does have very good connections so I think I am at an advantage. Overall it's been very good. I've made lots of freinds and it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English Literature," I like that my course offers fredom to be creative and think for yourself in terms of both reading and writing. Accommodation is very spacious and the bedrooms are lovely with great en-suites. It's good value as its so nice. It's close to lectures and is regularly cleaned. I love the city for shopping and the nightlife. The uni facilities are great and very modern. There's no need to go off campus often as everything is here. I've joined athletics and dance society. The SU is good, although they need to listen to people suggestions and take action where possible. The support services include a personal tutor and SU helpline. My degree will hopefully lead to good job prospects as Warwick has a good reputation. Overall I've absolutely loved it. The course is great and I've made some amazing friends!"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Computer Science," I like that there's very little lectures as it leaves time to do work independently. Accommodation is ok. The room is fine but kitchen appliances are often breaking. There is no city! The university facilities are good. Lots of stuff on campus including great sports facilities.I've really enjoyed clubs and societies so far. I've joined the computing society and warwick game design. The SU is quite small but has good facilities. There's also a variety of support services for all kinds of people. In terms of job prospects, all I can say is 'mate, have you not heard of Warwick?' Overall I've made freinds and really liked Warwick."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Chemistry," I like the chemistry cafes on Monday for help with work. Accommodation includes large rooms, good kitchen, en-suite but it is quite expensive. The city is good for bar crawls, going out, and for shopping with friends. Facilities are good, lots of places to eat and drink and the library is great and close by. I've joined chemsoc which is a lot of fun. The SU is close to accommodation but a little small. Support services include module tutors and a student mentor. Job prospects depend upon your grade. Overall its been great fun and really enjoyable, but hard work."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English Literature and History," I like the fact that my course is taught in small groups, making it good for intentive learning. My accommodation is pretty good value. I've got nice flatmates and a nice room. Leamington Spa is great for shopping. The facilities are great and well-kept, although I wish there was more variety of shops to buy basoc things like groceries. Costcutter is too expensive. I've joined Polish society and pole dancing which have been great for socialising. The SU is pretty cool. It gives students a lot of chances to socialise. Support services include an essay writing programme which I fine useful. As a future english teacher in germany, I think getting a job will be easy after erasmus in Warwick. Overall, I have loved it so far, and can't wait to spend the rest of the year here."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English and German BA (Hons)," I love it here, although sometimes my course can be a bit boring. The teachers are good though. Also the SU needs to be improved. It's a nice building and has the perfect set up for a club but there's not a whole lot of variety of events and sometimes it's not that busy. The facilities are really good although some of them are wayyyy overpriced. The gym is modern and the sports pitches are well maintained. There's loads of tarkets and astroturfs for sports. I've joined hockey and it's great. Accommodation is good, although equally, is very overpriced. I loved my year abroad last year and am happy that my university offered me that option on my course. Overall, it's been excellent!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,English Literature," I loved frehsers week, but they could have done a proper freshers week rather than a fortnight that included work and lectures! The SU is ok, but the copper rooms (the club) is pretty average. There is good support for employment services and tutors are only an email away! My course is interesting and the facilities around campus are great. My accommodation is a little expensive but it's really nice so I suppose you get what you pay for. I've joined aerobics and circling is great!"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History," I really like my module content, particularly making of the modern world. There's a lot of scope for module choice. Accommodation is pretty good. There's a large communal area in Arthur Vick, large rooms and plenty of storage. There's lots of choice for meals out and shopping in the nearby cities that are fairly good value. The facilities are modern and up to date, especially the gym. I've joined history society and it's great for socialising. The SU is pretty well organised although they don't always give student information concerning key development i.e. marking boycotts. Student mentors provide great support and there are career workshops, but not necessarily aimed at the areas I want to go into. Overall it's very enjoyable, but quieter than first expected."
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat2,rat5,,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Business Marketting," I really like my strategy module, it's really interesting. The accommodation is nice in general but the bed is way too small and not that comfortable. The nearby towns/cities are nice and there's always things going on at night. The uni facilities are great and modern but they are too far away from my accommodation. Otheriwse they are good. The clubs and societies are really mixed and varied, not just sports. The Student's Union is a cool place to hang out with freinds and has some nice places to drink. The support services have been helpful to me and helped me to settle in well. I think it will be easy to get a job when I go home. Overall, I like this university. It's a pleasant place to live and the people are super friendly."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," I really like that first year doesn't count towards my final grade, so I can enjoy the social aspects of uni a bit more. Accommodation is good value, but could have some nicer/more friendly cleaners. The nearby towns are great for going out to eat. The facilities are good, but I wish there were more laundry rooms, they can get very crowded. I've joined Finance and economics societies and they've been excellent for socials. The SU isn't bad, but events do get very repetitive. I haven't really encountered the support services, but that's because I don't need it. Hopefully job prospects will be very easy! Overall, the uni is decent. Lots of things to do for when you don;t feel like working, and good academic facilities for when you do."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Psychology," I love having a broad range of topics on my course. I also really enjoy the accommodation and think it's really good value for money (although we do have to move out at christmas/easter). Leamington Spa is nice but Coventry isn't great. I like the library and the gym but it is a bit expensive for a gym membership. I've still joined sports clubs though, like Badminton. The club at the SU is ok, but every night is sort of the same. We have great careers support services and regular careers fairs, and I have really enjoyed my time here overall."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," I really like proving theorems and getting that sense of achievement when I've completed it. The accommodation is good value and well maintained. The kitchens are really big and nice. The uni is a campus so not much city life but Coventry is ok I guess. All the facilities are good, not much room for improvement. I've joned northern society and it is one of many clubs that is great for socialising. The SU has a good bar and good places to eat. The service is good overall. There's good advertising of support services so that you know they're there if you need them. My degree has a very high employment rate which is good for my job prospects. Overall, I'm loving Warwick so far."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Computer Science," Great staff and good facilities. For accommodation, the 30-wek let is a good choice. Accommodation at Warwick is very nice in general. The campus is close to leamington and coventry where there are good clubs. Facilities are very good, and 24-hour labs are superb. There's a wide variety of clubs/societies, I've joined computing. The SU is good. There's regular events and elected leaders. There's good support with lots of freindly staff and nightline etc.. 100% of CS graduates last year got a job. Overall the people and staff are freindly, the accommodation is great, and everything is superb."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,History," I like that I get to look at history from a range of perspectives, especially in regards to global history. My accommodation is one of the more expensive ones on campus but there's lots of space and an en-suite. Coventry has a large shopping area but isn't the prettiest place. Leamington Spa is nice. Campus has a great range of social facilities including bars and restaurants. It has a good vibe. I've joined art and history societies and love them! The SU is great. It's in a good central location and has good facilities. Academically, there is a great support network. Within accommodation, there are also wardens which are on hand to deal with problems. Warwick has a high percentage if graduates in employment so hopefully job prospects are good. Overall, I really love it here! I've settled in well and am having a great time."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,International Management (including year abroad) BSc (Hons)," Accessible information online from WBS and teachers are friendly. The accommodation is great but there is a large amount of casual bullying. Birmingham is the only city and it's quite far away. Everything is nearby in terms of amenities. There's a wide variety of clubs and societies. I've joined pole dancing and sailing. The SU is freindly and good fun. There could be more events, especially on a thursday. I'm unsure about the support systems that are in place but I'm sure they are there if needed. In terms of job prospects, I have already been offered a position. Overall, it's been great fun and the course is excellent. Would definitely recommend Warwick to a friend."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," Accommodation is spacious. I have a good room and kitchen. However appliances often break and it is not cleaned often enough. Uni facilities are alright. However, they could provide more information about jobs other than banking and finance. Better tutors could be assigned, and changing your seminar tutors should be allowed. Also, books should be allowed to be issued for more than 3 days. I've joined breakdancing and economics society and they're great. The SU is good but small, and there's lots of careers fairs but not over a broad enough range of areas. Overall it's been ok. I've got amazing flatmates. I also have 3 amazing lectures, but 2 really bad ones..."
rat3,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Innovation and Entrepreneurship," Classes are conducted in a way that you actually learn. Accommodation is en-suite, spacious and nice. My favourite thing to do in the city is to go on pub crawls, which are always fun. I've joined thai boxing recently and it's ben a great way to meet new people. The Student's Union is always really helpful when it comes to queries or problems. I'm unsure about support services, but I feel like job prospects are going to be tough. Overall, it's been a really good experience so far. There are a couple of things I would change, mostly due to expenses and variety of things to do. The facilities make the university stand out."
rat3,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Innovation and Entrepreneurship," Courses are practical and well spaced out. The accommodation has excellent facilities and quality rooms. In terms of city life, the clubs can be good but you have to make sure to go to the right one on the right night otherwise it can be quiet. In terms of facilities, there should be more shuttles to commute into town. I've joined salsa class and its been really good so far. The student's union is very good at being proactive and the support services are very timely. Warwick is a good uni, so job prospects should be easier than they are. Overall though, my experience has been excellent. 5 stars."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Psychology," Different modules, so it creates variety in what you're studying. Accommodation is en-suite, and gets cleaned every Monday. Loads of space to put food and stuff, and is close to everyone and everything. Leamington is really nice but Coventry isn't that nice. The facilities are up to date, and the sports facilities are awesome. I've joined football, squash and table tennis which has been fun. The events at the SU are alright, they always play Mr.Brightside. Although, it shuts down at 2.30 which is too early, then you get told off by your resident tutor for having after-parties. Good support services and job prospects. Awesome overall. So much better than work or school."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Economics," I enjoy my course. The dept is generally well organised and the lecturers are generally good teachers who care about their students. I don't think thw facilities are great. Lots of the buildings are run down and the rooms are often too small. In general the facilities are too small/limited for the number of people at the university. Overall however, I've had a lot of fun. When you get a break from work there's loads of cool things to do both in the way of sports, societies and things like bars, restuarants and clubs. Sometimes Warwick is pricey but if you don't mind that then there really is not much limit to the activities you can get involved in! Love it!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Law," I enjoy the small seminar groups and interesting lectures. Accomodation is good. It has a big kitchen with lots of storage space at a reasonable price. The city life is non-existent. The library is great and has lots of equipment, and there are loads of societies to join. The SU are helpful and are great for finding out about campus activities. Support services are good and easily accessible. I think job prospects are good provided you work hard. Overall, it's a pretty good uni but I expected much more organization."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,23 Feb 15,Psychology," I find most of my course really interesting and the lectures are usually really engaging. Accommodation is quite expensive but the accommodation is really nice. Big rooms and communal areas. Coventry is nearby but it's not a particularly nice place. Birmingham is a great night out but a little further to get to. Facilities are really good. There's shops on campus and places to eat and also pubs/bars. Academic facilities are also good, i.e. research rooms and labs. I've joined aerobics, warwick snow and history which are all great. The SU is good but nights out could be improved. There's adequate support should you ever need it, so hopefully job prospects will be good. Overall, Warwick is a great place to spend 3 years. I'm definitely glad I came here."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Chemistry MChem (Hons), Fantastic university that I would recommend to anyone. Top tier in terms of facilities and job prospects. 
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Economics BSc (Hons)," I belive Warwick is one of the most result oriented Universities in the UK. Although they push you hard, they also make you reach your full potential. The campus is lovely, with lakes, parks, a own sportscentre and the largest Arts Centre in the UK outside of London. If you come to Warwick, you will definetly not regret. I have not.  With all its fairs, and good work from the Carriers and Skills Centre, you are certain to find the perfect job for you. I do Economics, and I love all my lectureres. They are so enthusiastic about their subects and that affects the students. The campus is HUGE. I've been a student here for half a year, and I haven't really yet had the need to leave campus.  I havent had many problems since I got here, but with the few incuiries Ive had, I got excelent help from the university! I love their work, and their parties are amazing (for those caring about that). The campus accomodations are great! You get your own room, many of them are en suites, and because you share kitchen you are guarantied a new family.  The Uni is between two cities, one for shopping and one for partying. Its also only 20 minutes from Birmingham."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,History and Politics BA (Hons)," Very much a campus uni - 30-40 minute bus ride from Leamington (where most people live) to campus, but first years guaranteed campus accommodation. Pretty campus, easily accessible shops. Loads of opportunities for extra curricular stuff, amazing societies. Academic - seminar sizes vary, in general courses are good, feedback timely and comprehensive.  If you want to work in business or finance warwick is the place to be. Similarly lots of law opportunities - somewhat less for others but the university's own jobs site is good all round. Some amazing, absolutely incredible, others more varied - read reviews of modules. Study space fine in general, occasionally crowded but broadly enough capacity, and they are building more. Generally good, nightline service etc - sometimes necessary to go looking for support but is there. Societies amazing, so many opportunities to grow and have great times. Union facilities good, reasonable facilities. All fairly nice on campus - but not cheap. It is not possible to live at the university on the basic student loan. If you want a city university this is not it. Leamington is a lovely town though  See above"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Chemistry MChem (Hons)," So, so happy I chose to firm Warwick! I love the campus, the diverse student body...everything! The university is perfect for students who don't want to live amidst the hustle-bustle of the city, and like the idea of being in a 'student cocoon' whilst studying! Coventry as a city isn't the prettiest, but neighbouring Leamington Spa, is lovely to visit!  There's no other way to put it, employers love Warwick graduates, as we're equipped with the best skills as well as intellect (but we're not just able to regurgitate reems of knowledge!)."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat2,rat4,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Amazing atmosphere on Campus, such a beautiful place, lectures are engaging and committed to helping. Real community feel and plenty to do all the time, good reputation and Leamington Spa is close by so nice to have that Great reputation among employers, good careers advice service too Study areas can sometimes be a bit crowded, hard to find somewhere suitable to work A lot of student support available, well run! Absolutely loved living in halls, not much 3rd year accommodation but amazing first year Campus uni so not near a city, bit of a downside Amazing range of choice! "
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Civil Engineering MEng (Hons)," Strong reputation for job seeking
General driven mentality for success emanates through university
Good variety of sports clubs and societies
Distinctly average range of social venues (pubs and clubs)
Expensive facilities on campus
Library very busy and getting increasingly worse through time here
Constant developments on campus very disruptive and an eye sore Excellent support structure
Multiple events Some teaching of good quality, other times extremely poor. Generally good Good but getting busy. A nightmare around exam and deadline times Lots available Expensive. Only one night a week (Pop!) and one off events worth going to. Perfectly adequate, rather pricey  Campus uni, Leamington a pleasant environment to live in and commute from Large variety
Time in the lacrosse club made the university experience "
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,22 Feb 15,Mathematics MMath," I'm satisfied with the majority of my experiences at university. The campus is good with a range of scenery and services so even though it's quite far away from other places, you don't need to leave. I feel like I had a fair amount of help available with my course although I don't think we were encouraged to make the most of it Very good at getting students into jobs Lecturers vary. Some amazing but others could improve Good communication with students. Offer a fair range of activities, events and services Range of prices on campus but quality massively various.  Transport is quite an issue Good variety although the culture within sports clubs isn't culturally appealing to all"
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,,rat1,rat4,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,16 Dec 14,Film and Literature BA (Hons)," A very campus-centre uni that offers the full experience of nightlife, sociability and the learning side of everything too. Good facilities, and outstanding teachers at the forefront of research. Loads of career-centred activities and fairs on all the time, graduate employers directly come onto campus and seek out Warwick students and loads of people secure internships, work experience placements and much more just because they have attended the university. Love my course, my favourite part of the experience. Teachers are so knowledgeable and you know you are being taught by the pioneers of the study of Film. They expect high levels of commitment but you know you're getting a worthwhile degree out of it; it's not a joke course but something that these teachers are fully invested in and they really care about your contributions to seminars.  Library is amazing but never enough space; the actual book lending part cannot be beaten, they have such a fantastic range of interesting and relevant books! If you had time and you really liked your course, there's loads to choose from and I have found the library the number one most helpful thing in regards to revision and essay writing obviously. Only issue is that they should patrol people in there because so many sit on Facebook and take up a space that someone could use to actually work... However, learning grids are all great too, there's loads of places to drink/eat (expensive though..would suggest not eating on campus) and the facilities like kitchens and toilets are always really clean. It's okay, some people are really helpful when you have issues but at other times they are not so good. No point ever trying to raise a complaint to the SU as they do not take you seriously and don't try to help. Also NEVER use Warwick Accommodation to get your house after you move off campus! Worst people ever, do not trust them or believe them, they refuse to sort out any house issues and avoid and avoid emails and phone calls and squirm out of all responsibilities. They sort no house damage or structural damage, will not repair anything, do not give inventories and couldn't even bill us on time. DO NOT GET YOUR HOUSE WITH THEM. Not worth it, too expensive and the nightlife is better outside of campus. However the actual SU in terms of the team are really great and take care of issues quickly and efficiently. Also, the SU releases random statements boycotting/against certain things and not others... not the most representative democratic situation. Good, not amazing but it all depends how much you want to pay; cheaper rooms like the ones I stayed in were fine for my needs, sharing a bathroom WAS SO EASY and NOTHING to be scared of! I paid £91 a week and had a friend paying £134 a week just for the en suite...not worth it, save your money and just cope with sharing the bathrooms as it isn't the end of the world. All amenities worked really well, hot water, electricity, heating etc was never a problem. Any issues and security would come over really fast so sort it. I love Leamington Spa which is where I live as a 2nd year currently. Pretty town, very safe, and loads to do. I am from a city so it's nice to be near something that is like home. Shopping is awesome (sorry bank account) and the local family owned shops are great. No complaints about prices either, you can't beat the student discounts in Leamington, with drinks at 75p a shot and take outs etc all taking into account the student population. Loads of family areas too, so not just all student-y. Film Society is really good so far, such a big range of things to join so you won't be short of choice. Everyone is kind and welcoming even if you want to start something new. However, would say sports societies are not welcoming and are elitist, no such thing as just joining a sport for a laugh or to try it at Warwick as they are so cliquey and do 'initiations' in which people who want to join have to do stuff like strip off and drink or eat curry powder etc... would rather not, thanks. However normal societies are great and arrange loads of trips/events and stuff. They seem to be really accepting of all types of people no matter what beliefs/religion/race etc, never ever encountered any problems, and they arrange events that cater to both people that do and don't drink/enjoy clubbing."
rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,rat2,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,07 Dec 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Good uni overall, but there are a few things they fail to do. Lack of stress on volunteer experiences/work experience, promise student mentors but have never met any on my course. However, it's a very picturesque campus and a good place to be. Not necessarily a good uni for all subjects - they place a lot of emphasis and invest more into science subjects. Fail to stress the importance of getting work experience. You only get info if you actively seek it. More academically based, rather than focused on how you can use your degree once you're done. Not a particularly good uni for psychology - a lot more investment in other areas. However, have a good range of courses and allow outside modules. Lecturers are not always engaging unfortunately and some tend to just read off slides which is not an interesting way to learn. Lots of useful working areas. Sometimes hard to know which person you need to contact for different things. Has all the essentials. Pretty varied. There are some good accommodations, but the uni is also half maintaining some accommodations which they've previously said they're going to knock down.  It's a campus, but buses make it easier to go to Leamington/Coventry.  Wide range."

I would like to enjoy the social aspects of my first year more... The library is good as there's areas where you can talk and quiet areas for when you need to work! would recommend Warwick for sure! Hopefully, relatively easy.... maybe..... The people are really friendly and some of the lecturers are great. Some are a little bit boring though! Great facilities overall. The gym is basically brand new and they're always building new stuff all over campus! The health service is good as long as you book in advance, and the mentor scheme the uni operates is also worth doing. The club is pretty good. Its two floors with 3 bars. However it could be a little cheaper. And it could be open a bit later!! Good value, en-suite, decent room size and fairly cheap. A larger fridge and also a larger kitchen might have been nice in hindsight! My favourite thing to do is go on pub crawls, which happen fairly regularly! Floorball, Big Band, MORSE society"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,10 Nov 14,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," I'm enjoying my time here at Warwick. Housemates are all great and my course is going ok. My accommodation is pretty close to all the main facilities (of which their are lots). Loads of options for stuff to do in your down time e.g sports, clubs, societies, bars, club etc... Hopefully it should be fairly easy. Warwick is supposed to be good for that kind of thing! I'll have to wait and see though. The best thing about my course is the seminars. They're taught in small groups so they're great for understanding the topic. Lecturers are good aswell. The facilities are great. Unfortunately, I can't afford to use them because things like the gym are so expensive. So I guess that's what could be improved! I haven't used any of these services but I'm sure they're fine. I've heard good things. The terrace bar, the dirty duck, the bread oven and copper rooms are all sound. Been out a load of times and enjoyed myself. Accommodation is good if not a little expensive. Rooms are a tad small but they're en-suite so I can't complain. There is no city really, its a campus. There's coventry and leamington which are ok. I have not joined any clubs or societies"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat1,rat1,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Chemistry BSc (Hons)," It was a bit overwhelming at first. But I'm starting to feel more comfortable here. There could be more on offer to help us through the jump. Other than that people are really nice and halls are also well kept and modern. Hopefully really easy, because it's a great university for chemistry. I enjoy tutorials. They are helpful. Great time to ask questions and also to get to know people on the course. The facilities are great, modern and central. I can't think of anything to improve. My personal tutor's been really helpful. There is also a student support hotline and resident tutors. They are also good although I haven't had much experience with them. There's a good atmosphere at the SU. It feels safe as there is a lot of security. There's also quite a lot of varied entertainment. I think it is good value as you get a lot for what you pay. It's in a very central place as well, although some halls are quite far away (Westwood). NA (there is no city) NA (I have not joined any clubs or societies)"
rat2,rat1,rat3,rat2,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Economics BSc (Hons)," My course is harder than I thought and is frequently too much work, doesn't leave a lot of time to have fun. The SU is ok but could be better. Accommodation/costcutter is way too expensive. Also there's no city. Job prospects are only good if you get a decent grade and I don't feel like my course is going to allow for that. Seminars are the best thing about my course. They give you an opportunity to discuss things you're unsure of and go over difficult topics. I enjoy the sports halls and squash courts. I didn't get gym membership because it was too expensive, so I guess that could be improved. My personal tutor has been helpful with a difficult course, and some of the careers talks and events are quite useful sometimes. The student union is ok for opportunities with various clubs, but there's no stand out great night and the drinks can be expensive if you want to order something a bit different. This is difficult to judge, I'm not sure what represents 'good value' but the rooms are nice and they're en-suite so that is a plus. I like to go out to clubs etc.. WFS, WBS, Rowing"
rat4,rat5,rat2,rat5,rat5,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Sociology BA (Hons)," It's great!! Make sure you branch out from campus and go to Leamington/Coventry for nights out. The SU is good but there's loads of other places to go. Also leamington is quite good for shopping :) The uni is well respected so I don't feel like getting a job will be horribly difficult! There's also good careers services (so I'm told). To be honest my course is not what I expected. It's a lot harder than I thought and it's fairly intense. Would have picked something different in hindsight. Very good- there's nothing that isnt on campus. There's a gym, club, costcutter, costa and sports centre. Nothing I would improve off the top of my head! We're each allocated a personal tutor who is really helpful with academic issues. Overall the student's union is good. Pop is a really good night on a wednesday especially if you go with your sports team and circle. Very good accommodation! Although apparently JM3 has not been refurbished like the others. The location is great! close to the SU and shops. I like to go to Kasbah in coventry and clubs/bars. CMD, Sociology"
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Engineering BEng (Hons)," Although my course has been pretty intense, Warwick's been great. It's always eventful and everyone here is awesome! Love all the socials and feel like there's a good work/life balance if you do it right. Haven't really experienced much of this yet as I'm a first year, but from what I've heard job prospects are good at Warwick, and I like to think finding a job will be very doable. The best thing about my course is the great variety of modules on offer. Wish we had another fridge in our kitchen! Other than that facilities are great. The campus itself is a really nice place to hang out. Careers services are great. There's also things like nightline and student support officers. Also each kitchen has a resident tutor to sort out any problems. The SU is great. Lots of different events on and great variety. If you go at the right time, there's good drinks deals to be had as well. Terrace bar is good. Accommodation is nice and fairly good value. Good services such as cleaners and nearby facilities for laundry, doctors, shops etc... Its a campus uni but there's leamington and coventry. My favourite thing to do in the city is to go to house parties. Engineering, Finance"
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat4,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Law LLB," Everything has been great so far. Great nightlife even though I wasn't expecting it, and loads of things to do during the day when you're not working. The library is great as is the sports facilities. Loving my time here!!!!!! Employability and networking opportunities are great here. So, I think it will be fairly easy. The best thing about my course is the Tort Law lecturer, Paul Raffield. He's great!  Great! Also, everything is in close proximity so you're a stones throw away from all the sporting facilities and academic facilities. Everything is great. I've had a few encounters with Warwick's student finance as they were not very co-operative or helpful. It's really good. A nice setup and occasionally hosts really good nights. It's a shame so many of the nights aren't great, but I suppose there needs to be something different for everyone. Great rooms and kitchen. Would be great if we had another fridge as we only have half a shelf. Also a washing machine and internal laundrette would be ideal. My favourite thing to do is go to Wagamamas. Law and Philosophy"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat2,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,"Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics (MORSE) MMorse"," Really good so far. My course is varied and interesting and I'm busy but don't have a ridiculous amount of work. Everyone's really nice and halls are sociable. I'd definitely pick Warwick again if I went back in time! Warwick has supposedly great job prospects but as first year I haven't really experienced this. I think finding a job will be a challenge but do-able. My course is interesting and my lecturers are generally good at their job. Some of them could try and make it more interesting though. The work load is a good balance. Again, really nice facilities. The gym is great but can get very crowded. This is the only improvement I can thin of! I haven't used any of the support services but here they're ok. The SU has a lot on offer for people of all tastes. Sometimes it gets rowdy but a lot of people like that. There's also loads of events that don't revolve around getting drunk. Something for everyone! Very nice halls but could be cheaper. The kitchen is a good size and we have cleaners to make sure it doesn't get into too much of a state. Great people! It's a campus! The nearest city is coventry and isn't the nicest place but there are things to do. My favourite thing is clubbing! photography, poledancing, larps"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,History and Politics BA (Hons)," Everyone here is really nice. Also, the course is excellent. Am loving my time here so far, and looking forward to the next few years. Make sure to get involved with all the clubs and societies while you're here as well! Fairly easy, there's lots of help available from the careers services and personal tutors. My course has been interesting and varied thus far. This is probably the best thing about it. Looking forward to seeing how it goes throughout the year. Facilities are good but the gym and sports membership is too expensive. They could do with subsidising this further to make it more accessible. There seems to be a lot of support on offer, although I haven't used any of these services. I quite like the student union. They have good offers although sometimes could be better. Some good nights but only really one per week. Fairly good value. nice rooms and nice people. preferably could do with another fridge as there's not really enough space for everyone's stuff. Too far away, although my favourite thing is going to restaurants and clubs. RAG"
rat1,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat1,,rat2,rat3,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Engineering BEng (Hons)," My experience so far has been very bad. Accommodation is expensive and not worth the money, there is not enough that the SU does to cater for all tastes, my course so far has been uninteresting and difficult and the facilities are too expensive. Warwick is supposed to be good for jobs but we'll have to see how my course goes before I make any predictions about my future career. The best thing about my lectures is when the end. Boring and tiresome. Facilities at the university are average compared to others I've seen. The gym is nice and new but needs to be bigger. Also, they need to have more of a contingency plan for bad weather with the sports pitches. I haven't used any support services or even been made aware of any. The student union is expensive and the events are generally not that good. They need to do more to get students to actually show up to a lot of these events. accommodation is en-suite which is good and the rooms and relatively large as well as the kitchen. The only problem is the price. There is no city. Warwick is a campus Uni, but my favourite thing to do is clubs. ACS- an absolute joke (made you play musical chairs) french speaking society- average. finance societies- brilliant"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat3,,rat3,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons)," Pretty decent overall. Not too much in the way of nightlife but leamington and coventry both have a few clubs to offer. Also Birmingham isn't too far away and they offer transport services to take you there and back for nights out. Can't be too hard right? I think Warwick is supposed to be good for that kind of thing. The best thing about my course is that often we finish our lectures early. Facilities are not bad, but could be improved by providing more pubs in and around campus. There are only really 2 to choose from. This is not applicable for me, as I haven't used the support services. Love it. Lot's of stuff to do, although after a while the same nights do get a bit old. They should try and change it up a a bit, and make the drinks cheaper so that people are more inclined to go and the club would be busier. £50 extra for an en-suite seems a bit much. But generally the accommodation is really nice, so I would say it's good value. My favourite thing to do in Leamington is going to the club, Neon. Biosoc, Chemsoc, Rugby"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons)," Very good. The uni has a good balance of social aspects of university and also the academic side. I've enjoyed getting involved with clubs and sports, and have had a lot of fun with my house mates and course mates. I think it will be fairly easy. Both my uni and my course have good job prospects. The best things are the facilities and the standard of teaching. Lecture halls are nice and the teachers are helpful. The uni has good sports halls and the gym is new and well equipped. Weights room could be bigger, they don't need that much rooms for cross trainers. Tutors are easy to talk to and most of the time easy to get into contact with. I haven't used the other services. Pop and flirt Friday's are both good. Our freshers week had some good acts and events on. Could be cheaper. The rooms are nice and spacious and the kitchens are well equipped and good for socialising. Good value. Clubbing is my favourite thing to do in the city Chemsoc and dodgeball"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Computer Science BSc (Hons)," It's been great. Everyone I've met has been friendly. However, the work load is a lot to handle. I'd recommend people to ensure they stay on top of it from day one! great flat though, and nice places to eat nearby. Computer science has a great job prospects rate at Warwick, so I feel good about getting a job. I really enjoy the lab sessions and practical work offered by my course. This is probably the best thing about it. The uni has great facilities in terms of sport and computer facilities. Improvements could be made in the cost! The uni offers health support, nightline and personal tutors who can help you deal with any trouble with work. It's good. Lots of different events that everyone can enjoy. There's also a good selection of establishments depending on whether or not you want a loud night or a quiet one. Very good. Big. The only downside is having to pack up and move all my things out at Christmas and Easter. My favourite thing is to go out with friends to clubs and bars. The boar, matchday society"
rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Economics BSc (Hons)," Other than my second week, I've had a really great time so far! Copious facilities. It's a little bit annoying that we're not in a city but I knew that before I came. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. The university provides a great launch-pad with which to get into a successful career pathway. I feel like I could get a job easily. The best thing about my course is that they offer breaks in the middle of long lectures to give you a chance to eat/drink and re-focus. Great sports facilities. The gym and the pitches are great. I also love the swimming pool. No improvement needed! Nightline, health support, personal tutors. The SU is great and helps me to socialise. Drinks prices are ok, but sometimes could be cheaper considering its an exclusively student establishment. Good value! It's a tad expensive but I have an en-suite so I'm not complaining! We have cleaners so the kitchens are in reasonable condition most of the time. My favourite things to do are eating out with friends and going to clubs. Nsoc, ACS, Economics"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Economics BSc (Hons)," It's been really enjoyable. I love my halls and my housemates. The nightlife scene is mixed but provides a decent social life if you're willing to travel a short distance. The SU is also good, but I have seen better. I feel like job-searching should be easy. Warwick has a good reputation and I've been to lots of helpful careers sessions and talks There is a mixture of different topics. i.e. maths, history. macroeconomics, microeconomics, accounting. I enjoy the variety and the standard of teaching. Facilities are generally very good. Kitchen space could be improved i.e. slightly bigger. Also the gym could be a little cheaper. The university provides things like career support and support for other issues. I've heard they can be helpful. The bars/club is good, but the union could do more to make their weekly events attractive to students. I've found there's only really one weekly SU events that consistently draws a crowd. Accommodation is rather expensive, however I've really enjoyed it so far. So I suppose in that respect, it's been good value for money. My favourite thing to do in the city is eating and drinking! There are lots of good places in nearby Leamington Spa. Economics, Finance, Investment Club."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)," I have enjoyed it immensely. Laughs on tap and more student union events than you could shake an Apple VK at. Halls are great fun and people here are, for the most part, really nice. My course is also interesting.  It would be easy if I was interested in going into banking/finance. Unfortunately I am too much of a free spirit for that. Warwick is bad at highlighting non-mainstream routes. I've definitely enjoyed my course. Lecturers are generally very good and the workload is just right. I wish essays/exams were more spaced out though. There can be bunching. The gym is unfeasibly expensive. They should have more free or subsidised classes. I would also like a dentist and for the health centre to be open on weekends. I haven't utilised the student support services but I've heard they have good career support (for certain careers) To be honest, the SU has not affected me too much, other than the copper rooms and terrace bar, which I have enjoyed. I would not say that there is a whole lot of variety, although there are lots of fun SU night-out orientated events. It is expensive. Tocil has kitchens too small and too hot for 12 people and there is also not enough kitchen storage for all my things. The showers are nice though Going to the local weatherspoons with my pals. Lacrosse. Some of the clubs aren't very inclusive and a bit cliquey."
rat4,rat2,rat3,rat4,rat3,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,09 Nov 14,Law LLB," It's been a great 4 years, but overall I am happy to be moving on and doing something different with my life. I’d definitely recommend my uni to others considering Warwick, and would also recommend my course.  If I wanted to become a commercial lawyer or a banker, I would love the job prospects here. However I don't, so perhaps feel like there could be more on offer for me. There are interesting modules, however some lecturers do just read from a powerpoint, which can feel like a waste of time. There should be free women's self-defence classes, and also I think the health centre should make sure it's open on weekends. I'm incredibly self-assured and secure in myself so have never had to reach out to a support service. However, I am sure they are adequate if I was ever in need. It's nice. it's got a good social scene and lots of food outlets. The main club is great for 'slammin babes'.  Tocil's kitchens are too small and way too hot for 12 people. Our kitchen is the same size as the flat above, but they only have 6 people! Nandos. Rosie Malones. Kassy B. Maybe you could even hit the Sky Dome for Jumpin' Jacks or catch a flick at the Odeon. Coventry is the land of dreams. Mixed netball, Lacrosse, Law Soc- there is definitely something for everyone."

As for the social side of the University, you have the Warwick Arts Centre, the nightlife and restaurants on central campus as well as towards Leamington is diverse, bohemian, there is generally something for everyone! The societies are also brilliant to with Comedy societies all the way through to Rowing! "
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat2,,,rat3,rat5,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,10 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc), I like my university and all the possibilities it is offering me.

I learn knowledge from books, teachers and my classmates. I learn many interesting things from my friends. My friends are from different countries. I think it is a good chance for culture exchange especially in this historical city. I hope more non- China students can come to here."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,10 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc," I like it that the modules are established, but it is difficult when exam papers changes their format because there is no past papers to refer to. It is good that the university is researched based so there are opportunities for students to join and gained extra income from there. The facilities are good overall but the sports and clubs fee is expensive so I resent joining. The Warwick Volunteers initiative is great in giving opportunities to volunteers in exploring new things. Accommodation on campus is quite expensive. Costcutter in the university is more expensive compared to other stores but that is maybe because they are the only store in the university site. Lecturers, tutors and staff are very helpful."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat2,,,rat2,,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,10 Apr 14,Mathematics and Business Studies BSc (Hons)," HEFP belongs to the university of Warwick and I ID card told me I am a Warwick’s student, but I do not think so. Other University will give some guarantees for their students about their university application, however, Warwick did nothing. Compare with students in other university, I study harder here for a year but the university don’t give any guarantee. It make me fell sad."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat2,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,10 Apr 14,," Very good university but annoyed about the number of strikes. 
People are friendly, social life is generally good but city life is pretty limited."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat2,,,rat1,,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Business Studies BSc (Hons)," The life and travel in Stratford-upon-avon is convenient. 2 min’s walk way from accommodation to teaching building. 5 min’s walk way from accommodation to the railway station and 10 min’s walk to the town centre. Opposite the college, there is a big supermarket-- Morrision’s"
rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Business Studies BSc (Hons)," Stratford- upon-avon is a very very very very small college and for our foundation students, we only allow to use two teaching buildings. I cannot deny the quality of teaching in there is good, but the outside look and the college facilities are not as good as I think. I suggest college can invest more on the facilities."

However, I come from a very large city (Sao Paulo) and the lack of diversity in terms of restaurants, clubs, and shops in general drives me crazy. This was especially the case when living on campus, but now in Leamington the case is not as bad. Other than this, very major flaw, I adore Warwick University."

rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,European Law LLB (Hons)," Studying in Warwick has been a dream during my last years of High School. It is a very green university, it makes efforts to respect the environment and simultaneously offers high quality teaching to its students. Even though I do not agree with some of their measures and rules (e.g.; Time to get feedback, SU being inconsistent in its decisions towards societies, etc.), I do believe that Warwick is an amazing university, preparing its students at their very best for a bright and successful future."

rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Like the teaching methods. The campus itself is good . Only problem is campus life can get quite repetitive and boring if you come from a city lift

The feedback from lecturers is good, most notes are available online, and lectures are usually delivered in a stimulating way.

There is a great balance between 'geeky' and 'cool'. Only downside is out of London location but that's just a first world problem
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biomedical Science BSc (Hons)," I love the family feel of the campus, and how everything is so close by.

rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Business BSc (Hons)," Warwick University is great because of the job prospects gained from studying at such a reputable University (particularly the business school). The city life isn't great (nightlife etc) and often one can feel slightly claustrophobic on campus. The commute from Leamington Spa to campus is also pretty inconvenient. On the whole, I am a big fan of Warwick University and would recommend it to others looking to join."

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Philosophy (PhD)," I thought that the academic side of my time at uni has been generally good, with no major problems ever occurring.

Only the supermarket is a bit expensive"

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc)," I like how the university is made up as a campus, and the pressure and possibilities of succeeding both when in university and when it comes to future job prospects. However, the pressure can sometimes be a bit too high for getting the highest grades, being involved in all kinds of societies and also getting internships and spring weeks."

the parking costs/lack of parking

the fact they have recently cut lots of campus trees down"

I love getting involved in youth organizations on campus and always find an area to fit in just because of the wide array of cultures and interests that exist on campus. So sad it's coming to an end. Would definitely do it all over again."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat5,rat3,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc," I really like the international community at Warwick. It's been a great learning experience knowing and meeting people from different countries. I also like the Warwick students union, I feel like there's something for everybody in terms of extra-curriculars. I find my course interesting and I feel that the education we're getting here is of great quality. What I don't like is the lack of good food outlets/restaurants on campus, as well as the limited provisions for students staying off-campus."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," Very academically stimulating, good atmosphere, very supportive staff, friendly students. Some of the events are done quite late in the evening so some people can’t attend. A lot of employer events. "
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Business BSc (Hons)," Love Warwick! Highlights: location in England (while it's not too far from big cities, it's not in one itself so we get the best of both worlds by avoiding the hecticness that comes with living in a city all the while being close to them), reputation, campus and facilities, long holiday periods, very good university spirit, very dynamic university. Negative aspects: lecturers are not very good"
rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Biotechnology, Bioprocessing and Business Management (MSc)", Warwick business school is poorly organised and a shambles at times. I'd expect more from such a highly ranked school
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Most of the people are very friendly and I think that there is an excellent work/social balance. Furthermore, the course I am pursuing is rigorous and challenging yet very enjoyable, enhanced by the high teaching standards of the lecturers."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Business BSc (Hons), I love my University because it is campus and people get very close. The societies are outstanding and you really feel like you are a part of something bigger.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Biotechnology, Bioprocessing and Business Management (MSc)"," Like that it is a campus University and not located in a big city as it forces you to bond with friends and meet new people. Also, helps with concentration.
Dislike the exam timetable."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Biotechnology, Bioprocessing and Business Management (MSc)", A very much isolated area but this University is somewhere you can make great friends and concentrate on your studies.
rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Biotechnology, Bioprocessing and Business Management (MSc)", Bad accommodation for 2nd and 3rd years
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Instrumental and Analytical Methods in Biological and Environmental Chemistry PgDip, It's a nice university but it is isolated in the middle of nowhere so the social life is not great.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc), great uni
rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History and Politics BA (Hons)," Good: 
- conducive environment for undergraduate studies 
- also gain a good foundation for character-building 
- wonderful variety of societies 
- cost-friendly 
Not so good: 
- 30 CAT modules in my department 
- prevents the ability to have a larger variety 
- tutors are not always fair or friendly 
- needs a stronger understanding and awareness of the balance between studies and extracurriculars"
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys, Workload is a lot to handle but my course is very interesting. I've had some great accommodation for reasonable rent. The towns and cities near campus don’t have a huge amount going on but they’re nice enough. The university staff has always been exceptionally helpful. Overall I’d say it was a very good university.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I have loved my time at Warwick, it has made me into the person I am today: I'm more confident, more employable and have had a great time here. Only complaint is it's a bit of a bubble!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," It's got great prospects, particularly for my course. Sucks that's it's so out of the way though."
rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Biotechnology, Bioprocessing and Business Management (MSc)"," The people you meet and the social life is good. The course is a disappointment, very few contact hours and many of the lecturers/tutors are not as impressive as I had hoped. The way they mark your assignments is appalling; feedback is often uniform and not helpful."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons), There is a big mix of friendly welcoming people from all over the world. There is no discrimination and a general good vibe. Lecturers are generally good and treat everyone as an equal
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, -
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, Great academic and career wise as well as a good social side
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, It's a very good university with a lot of presence of employers through company presentations and the like. The students are very approachable and it is easy to settle in also.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I love Warwick, as it is not only one of the best universities in the country but holds the best environment for a student to explore new dimensions, it is the ultimate university experience"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc)," The university has a good study atmosphere with great teaching professionals and well designed course. However, food on campus can be improved."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc," Truly enjoying my time here. Met many like-minded people, got heavily involved in societies, and I feel I'm really growing as a person in this atmosphere. University course could be more inspiring however. It is taught very well, but we're not encouraged to see the bigger picture with all the amazing things we can do with our lives."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat2,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research (MSc)," Good, though Union is over priced and admissions favours internationals too much."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law and Business Studies BA (Hons), The best selling point Warwick Business School has is that it is 75% international! You meet a range of wonderful people!
rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc), It's great cos I get to meet like minded people from all over the world. Lectures are disappointing and monotonous - in few modules going for the lecture has no real advantage. As a top university I feel the quality of education should be much better
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil, Love the University and would recommend it to anyone.
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys," Both an advantage and disadvantage of Warwick is it's very much a campus uni, and life can get a little sheltered. Living in Leamington helps a little, but it is very easy to stay close to home."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, We hate our Vice Chancellor
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research), Warwick's campus means that you get to know everyone really easily. High quality of teaching and a work hard play hard attitude!
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, A great university with a challenging and ambitious environment.There is always so much to do with conferences to other society events such that everyone can always find something that interests them while coping with the high academic demands.
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick Uni is in the country, a bit far from everywhere (but if you get to coventry then in 1hr you get to london). The teaching level is world class and the facilities are excellent. Ample networking opportunities for employment and great variety of societies."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," Although having not properly experienced life at a city university, I think that having a campus university benefits students, with everything you need within walking distance. It also creates a community of thousands of people your own age, with similar interests and hobbies. However, the library needs to be extended or other similar study areas created, as most of them get full during the daytime."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, overall I like it
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mechanical Engineering BEng (Hons), Great campus. Some great lecturers but not all of the. Business school is a waste of time
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biomedical Science BSc (Hons)," Warwick University is a great campus university with the largest students union in the country. The are 100s of clubs to get involved in, and although there is not that many clubs, there are bars and student union events to keep you occupied. The facilities are great, especially the library."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The university of Warwick has great study facilities, such as the library and several learning grids. Great articles database. Less impressed with the hidden study costs, such as printing, for example, and the ever increasing international fees. Student Union good at campaigning, but don't feel like the students actually get engaged. Some departments definitely up there, such as Economics."
rat2,rat4,rat3,rat1,,,rat1,rat1,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," Poor university life in general but the course is relatively good and challenging. However, efficiency of learning in terms of recordings and insightful lecturing is minimal."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," The university is friendly, the course is interesting with good options. Even though its not in a city there's still good places to go out and it's quite cheap."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall it is a great uni, great facilities, good atmosphere, although not everybody gets decent accomodation as promised. The SU is very good, very active, student support easily accesible. Societies and clubs are really important to the uni and really active, student life is satisfying and great fun. From an international's point of view, the weather sucks, but can't change it. Courses, lectures and seminars are really good and interesting, but sometimes challenging."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," Rootes is great and the clubs and socities are really good. Nightlife can be in leamington, coventry or birmigham so there is a good mixture."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick, especially the Business School, is excellent in terms of future prospects and career progression. The bubble is a bit secluded from Coventry and Leamington, but that can also be a good thing in terms of building a strong university experience and unique student life."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Enjoy the atmosphere and the closeness of facilities and amenities. Feel personal tutors could be more involved, but the departmental mentor scheme is really useful. Students in different years are friendly."
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Nice clean campus. Food outlets are expensive and generally poor. Good reputation of university. Good research and academics.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History and Sociology BA (Hons)," Really interestin course, sometimes the lectures aren't great though. Everything you need is on campus so little reason to leave makes it hard to leave. Pop is the best student union night and flatmates are great!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," Accomodation is comfortable and welcomming; along with the rest of campus it is equally safe. Facilities around campus definitely make up for it being in the middle of nowhere! Clubs and societies provide numerous opportunities to socialise and there is a wide range on offer. The course is ineteresting, yet there are alot of strikes considering how many contact hours we have."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys, Very good campus and very good people/students. City life could be better. Lots of extra things to do- sports/clubs/societies. Very good atmosphere for work/productivity. Sometimes wish students would be more integrated. Friednship groups frequently depend on your kitchen.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons), The SU is good. There's also a high standard of accomodation and facilities. My course is enjoyable with a high standard of lecturers. There's also many socities.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," So far life in Warwick is great thanks to sports clubs and friendly mates and societies. However, I think that the SU is not doing enough in terms of night life. Also, the food offer is not really diversified and the quality is of a low standard."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons), Lots of fun activities on campus. Lectures are useful and interesting. People are nice and friendly in general.
rat4,rat4,rat2,rat2,,,rat1,rat4,rat1,rat1,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The SU could be improved as the Copper Rooms doesn't usually have good nights. The laundrette could also be improved as the machines don't usually work. However, the fact that everything is on campus is good and safe."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," I would tell anyone to come to warwick. I've had a great time during my 3 years here. The business school is great, however the level of funding is not as I would hope."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The Maths department is one of the best in the country. The lecturers are leading researchers in their field. The course is tough. I live in Rootes, would recommend it, great atmosphere. Coventry and Leamington Spa don't have the best nightlife, but Birmingham isn't too far for a good night out."
rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Overall fine. Enjoying life at Warwick but the postroom is too far away
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Good uni in general. Lectures are good and the course is stimulating. Wish campus stores weren't so expensive, as tesco is a little walk away."
rat3,rat3,rat2,rat2,,,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Well, if you want to go to uni then think carefully aout what you actually want to do at uni because once you start you have to be very committed and organised. You may find that life is pointless at uni at times as it may get quite depressing having work all the time unless you do a course which requires minimal effort. Don't join the gym unless you know you can make time for it, same with clubs and societies as they may end up being a waste of your precious time and money. Be careful about the people you meet and become friends with as they may be hiding who they really are. Do a course that you are truly interested in and will put effort into otherwise consider doing an apprenticeship or do something else as uni will be a waste of your time and life force. Lecturers tend to be useless when you need help or dont understand something, so make friends with clever people or people who understand things well. Be prepared to feel fraustrated with lack of resources and help for £9000 a year."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick is a good uni overall. Despite the lack of eye-candy, the university is reputable and the facilities are very good also. Good choice of extra curricular activities/societies."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," University life is pretty good, the facilities around campus are good including the library and the warwick arts centre. The lectures are engaging and interesting, and the lecturers themselves are very supportive and will help with uni work. In terms of job prospects this university has a very high rating and is also very good in developing your skills as an individual to prepare you for the world of work."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," University life at Warwick is great. The campus is great with lots of attractions and lots of great people. The nightlight is also much better than I anticipated with lots of good nights out available each week in Leamington, Coventry, Birmingham and of course in the SU. Clubs are also great and sport is played to a high quality. The BUCs leagues enable regular, high quality fixtures."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," I was aprehensive about coming to a campus uni because I thought it would be really quiet and all my other choices were cities, and I was right. It's quite quiet and everything on campus is shut at weekends. But in 1st year we made our own fun and enjoyed the places we went out to. The course is also goos so I'm not complaining. Overall I've had a swell time!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Secondary Education (Science: Physics) PGCE," An alright course, proper fun. Wish that there were more seminars for science students, and also the hairdresser on campus should be cheaper."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, Good univeristy experience overall. The economics department is well organised. I'm pleased with my accomodation and the facilities I've found to be really good. The sports centre especially is brand new and very nice.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Overall Warwick is a great uni. My course in particular is very well organised and a good step up from a-levels. I'm lucky enougb to be living with a lovely bunch of people. So that makes being here so much better. I love it!
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I really enjoy university life at Warwick. Though it's quite secluded from the big cities, life here is still very interesting with friends on camps. I do enjoy the campus life in Warwick, especially when I get the chance to make new friends from all over the world."
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Although it can sometimes be quiet if you're in the wrong accomodation, as long as you find the right crowd, there's always something to do and good nights out to be had. The SU puts on some good events, but probably would benefit from being more consistent with these. UniBus organises good nights out in birmingham, leamington and coventry, so there's variety."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature and Creative Writing BA (Hons)," The lecturers are great, seminars could be better. I love the amount of societies there are and the sports centre is great too. Good proximity to arts centre, creative writing was a slight dissappointment."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc, Everything is good but I would prefer it if there were cheaper laundry services.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The accommodation is plush and ideally located for onsight activity, be in lectures, sports or nightlife.

rat2,rat2,rat3,rat2,,,rat5,rat2,rat1,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, The SU is pretty good but there should be another club/better bars on campus. Costcutter is so expensive (most expensive in the UK) and is the only nearby supermarket. There are good facilities and gym. Good and helpful seminar tutors and lecturers.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," Overall, its OK. Course has good lecturers though tutors could be more helpful. Generally good faciltiies on campus but most foot outlets are overpriced for their quality of food. "
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc)," Warwick is a top class university in terms of academics however compromises are to be made on the leisure side, especially if you're used to city life. Plenty of societies are there to keep you busy and people are all here for the same thing making it a good atmosphere for studying."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall, Warwick is a good university, allowing me as an international student to embrace the British education and culture. I chose a British university for the degree and reputation, and Warwick is ranked among the top class. Student life is incredible, every day an experience. Most of the lectures are good."
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research), Warwick is great for study with a great library and wonderful lecturers. The accomodation is fun but the social life is a little dull. Rootes is great and seminars are great.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Pretty darn good if you ask me! I would certainly recommend the university to domestic or international students. I've had a fun overall experience.
rat5,rat3,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Italian with Film Studies BA (Hons)," Since the film department here at Warwick is the best one in the country, I was quite happy with my choice. And since I'm also an international student I had high expectations since I was always comparing English universities to American ones. And if I have to be honest it has been an amazing experience and probably the best choice I've ever made. I love living here, and studying here as well."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Warwick has a great reputation. Rigorous course, but too many exams and can be very pressured. Good career prospects. Very happy with accomodation. MUST improve nightlife. More fun and cheap events at the SU needed."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Italian and Classics BA (Hons)," Very good, enjoyed being here. Would do a different course in hindsight. Very good facilities but wish things were cheaper in the SU/costcutter."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Secondary Education (Science: Physics) PGCE," I think Warwick is a great university, however in the Union staff can be hostile and difficul to work with. I enjoyed my time at warwick but there is room for improvement."
rat3,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat2,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The course and learning environment of the university is excellent and job prospects are very good. However, the location of the university can mean it gets a little boring as the nearest town is quite far away and there isnt a lot of student focusses outlets."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc, Sports facilities are really good. A lot of clubs and societies for students to join and great opportunity to meet other people from other countries. Basic facilities can all be found on campus!
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The SU puts on some cool events which makes up for the lack of city life. It's nice going there and seeing loads of people you know, and the events they hold have variety. Would be good to see something big on every Friday night in the SU. Course is good and facilities are also good."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Tunnelling and Underground Space (MSc), I also did my undergraduate here at warwick. Loved every minute of my 5 years here. Joined the american football team which really helped my integrating with the community. Accomodation on campus is good but getting to campus from leamington can be tiresome.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Good facilities, but some lecturers are incompetant."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Great course and study facilities. Some of the sporting facilities and social areas could probably be improved. However I am happy overall.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature PgDip, Much of the university experience is as good as you want it to be- making the most of your time and opportunities etc. But this is significantly easier and more rewarding at warwick. It is very well orientated to its students needs and it is a great place to continue your education.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, Good atmosphere and student life while on campus with a lot of opportunities for extra curricular activities. Good accomodation with adequate facilities and a lot of space for socialising. All lectures are good with decent detail on all the topics with further reading to improve an area you are having difficulty with.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Coming to university I didn't know what to expect, but Warwick has made it really easy to settle in with the large amount of support, sports clubs, societies, etc. Costcutters is quite pricey, but still convenient. Senate house closing at 8pm isn't ideal. "
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," This university has excellent facilities and a relazed atmosphere. It is great for international students as it is highly multicultural. The history course is excellent, lots of module choice and diverse teachings. Some bad lecturers, but what uni doesn't have them?! :)"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mechanical Engineering BEng (Hons)," There is a large variety of activities on campus ranging from sports to bars and nightlife. These are good places to chill out in, and the facilities are pretty good."

rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," As a history student at warwick university I am really enjoying my first year. Lectures are really helpful and seminar tutors are friendly and offer help whenever needed. In terms of nightlife, there are several clubs in the local area to go to as well as trips to birmingham."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Great university in terms of job prospects. Nightlife is good considering it’s a campus university. Rootes/Jack Martin/Arthur Vick are the best halls to pick if you want a good social side. University facilities are very good.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," It's a great place to study; challenging and ineteresting course materials. There's loads of great clubs and socities and also sports clubs to get involved in. There's also good nightlife in Leam, Coventry and Birmingham."
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat3,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc," what I enjoy the most in Warwick is the fact it is a campus university. So, I didn’t have to travel by the tube like city universities in London. Friends have been great especially my flatmates. However, I am dissappointed when there is not enough sport facilities to accomodate all students. The reason is, it is hard to use the westwood games hall since it is always fully booked. Hopefully, Warwick can add more indoor sports facilities."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Warwick has a great reputation especially for economics. It would be better if there were more restaurants on campus. Rootes is great and very sociable. However, work is relatively hard."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, It's a really good university with a really nice community feel. Evryone's been nice and I've had a great time with the people I was placed in a flat with.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," As an exchange student, I felt welcome by the students amd staff at Warwick. The accomodation is spacious and the lectures are accesible and interesting. I would definitely recommend Warwick to any student looking to meet nice people and learn a lot. (Please keep this review anonymous)."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Admission process is quite fast, and university administration is mostly effectively in dealing with problems, or schedules. The uni faculty is mostly good. The city life is a bit too dry. If looking for a happening city, then Birmingham (30 mins away) is the closest."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Decent place, sufficient amenities nearby, but not too much in the way of leisure, entertainment, shopping etc unfortunately."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat2,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I have really grown to like Warwick Univeristy, afteran uncertain first term. The support I have received has been phenomenal and really helped me come into my own. Excellent facilities and a great learning environment. The SU events could use some work, as they have not been as good as other nights out. Also, the gym is consistently busy, which is annoying as there are far more people than sensible for the equipment. Other than that, all is excellent."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," Gym needs to be bigger, not enough space for the thousands who will have signed up. Library and humanities facilities are excellent, but need cheaper eating places on campus."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall, I am pleased with Warwick University. Where I live, Jack Martin, everything is so close so it is really convenient. The people at Warwick are really friendly and it was easy to settle in. One complaint, however, is that Costcutters is too expensive."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I loved my time at Warwick, I feel I made some excellent friends and really matured as a person. The range of sports clubs on offer is amazing and I was able to take up many new sports and continue improving old hobbies. In older years (not freshers) everyone moves off campus, mainly to Leamington Spa. Its a really pretty town and far nicer than Coventry; however, the bus, run by Stagecoach, to and from university is an appaling service and is never on time. While Warwick is low on eye-candy, this does mean relatively speaking, you are more attractive, and if you are already moderately attractive then you have the pick of the bunch."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat5,rat3,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," Univeristy os generally good but the humanities block is rubbish. The SU and the other campus facilities however, and generally very good."

rat4,rat3,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," Generally good, if not a little cut off from 'real life' as campus/leamington are far apart. But mostly a good university all round."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," Great university which has great job prospects, solid teaching and great society events. To improve, it could have better student accomodatiin system for first years."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc, Warwick is a great uni. Learning at the business school has given me many opportunities and I am very excited to spend the next 3 years here!

rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Generally pretty good, but some parts of the course are less well run and well organised than others. But overall very good and am very pleased with the general atmosphere of the uni."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Good lecture halls and quality of teaching. SU not great, so nightlife on campus not great. Lots of learning resources and infrastructure. Shops on campus fairly expensive."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA, night life not as bad as people make out - quite a lot of clubs off campus. 1st year history is well-taught but still get the feeling I don't get £9000 worth. I'm taught by mainly phd students.
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Nice campus, opposite to a city university. A lot quieter because its in the middle of nowehere. Nice people, nice accomodation. SU always tries to have lots of different events on. VERY international, lots of people from different backgrounds."
rat3,rat2,rat3,rat4,,,rat2,rat3,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA," Pretty good fun, made some good friends. Although the nights out aren't great, it’s the people that make it! Starting to work abit harder in 3rd year but not too bad for 1st and 2nd."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Great university with several clubs and societies to join. Good job prospects and several opportunitiesto improve your personal skills.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Thoroughly enjoying me time at Warwick University. There are great opportunities for sport with a very welcoming attitude. Lectures are generally very good with a few exceptions. I really like the bubble feeling of being on a campus.
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys, I think Warwick offers a lot of career and social opportunities for students here. The lecturers are all good and the course is very interesting.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Only currently in second term, but really enjoying university life at Warwick. Campus is slightly internalised and isolated but plenty on it. Clubs etc in Leamington and Coventry mean social life is good too."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Good course and lecturers and work load. Great clubs and socials. I also rate uni express. There's also a lot of ineteresting people here.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Warwick is mostly for studying. The nightlife is not the best. Also, accomodation is not catered, and the food on campus isnt the cheapest."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The course is challenging, but rewarding. Constant assesment can be hard to cope with at times, however most individual pieces are of reasonable length. Accomodation is fantastic. Great atmosphere about the place, and the rest of campus. Campus buildings are nice. Everything is on campus, a true 'bubble' experience. Although this might not be for everyone."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons), Accommodation overall is great. There are lots of facilities.

rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons), Biochemistry at Warwick has been a fabtastic experience. The university has lots of schemes to help students gain experience and kick start their careers.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, the campus is its own small community with everything needed for living which is ideal for a first time living away from home. The SU provides a great social life as well as good night life in leamington and Coventry meaning there is always something to do. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Warwick.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I love being a part of this university. There are so many things you can get involved with, and the social events that go with them are so much fun. Everything is really close together on campus with means you're never too far away from the new friends you've made. The SU puts on loads of events during freshers which makes it really easy to settle in and meet people. There are also weekly events which people all go to and there are events throughout the term too which we all go to."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Theatre and Performance Studies BA (Hons)," There are many international students, so I could meet many nationalities even if I study here in the UK"
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat2,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," I've had a great time here at warwick. It's a great university to get involved with campus life and everything that goes with it, e.g clubs and societies, sports and the nightlife at the SU/bars."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," Lots happening. Full of nice people. Lectures and seminar tutors are interesting and helpful. Also, the library is great but apparently overcrowded during exam time."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys," I think that, for me, the main draw of Warwick was the course, the lectures and the access to other like-minded individuals, and it delivers completely on that promise. In terms of traditional student life (sports/nightlife) I find it lacking."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Overall the university is great. The course is really great and the staff are supportive. The only thing that lets it down is the location as we aren't near any cities.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," Great place to meet a large group of different people. The course is interesting but certain lecturers can be boring, but the seminars make up for that. Amazing range of clubs to join whatever your into. Accomodation is good quality mostly and is always lively and a laugh."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature PgDip," Warwick's great for English, the course is varied and the ground covered is huge. The SU could be better in terms of their big events and value for money but its good how the shops like curiosity put money back into the SU."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Solid departmental funding for the sciences and social sciences. Great links with leamington spa for nightlife and living environment for year2/3/4 of your degree. UOW is excellently received by employers arounf the UK, EU and afar resulting in better prospects from day 1 of your degree. The range of socieities fulfills a great range of interests."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," Engineering webiste is good, some lectures are abit boring but most are good. The course isn't as practical as other engineering courses. Not many socities for people who don’t play a sport."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature and Creative Writing BA (Hons)," The university gives you lots of information about a range of opportunities in terms of both societies and academic options. There are lots of opporunities to meet new people and there is always something new to do if you feel like it. Student support is really good, but accomodation services could be a bit quicker to respond to faults."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Really like the atmosphere on campus, like the balance between city and campus life. Lectures are good, given a lot of one-to-one with teachers. Nightlife is expensive. The cost of uni is a lot more than at home (regional differences). Accomodation is good. Maintenance is well kept. The cleaner is lovely! Love Warwick!"
rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Once upon a time there was a boy called Hugh. He had a pet dog. One day he went to the University of Warwick. He liked it a lot. One time he drank a whole bottle of Fanta and went really crazy. And one other time he found a 10p coin on the floor and bought himself a donut. The end!
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biological Sciences MPhil," A nice place to live, with a community feel. Ive enjoyed my first term here and everyone I've met has been great. Definitely would recommend to others."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Theatre and Performance Studies BA (Hons)," I've loved warwick so far, great people, facilities and lectures. Some people complain about the nightlife, but it is what you make it. If you want to meet fun, outgoing people and go out all the time, you will definitely be able to. Leamington, coventry and birmingham between them have plenty of clubs. You will not get bored if you make the effort."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall I have had a good university experience. My course has been challenging but the tutor support system and facilities on campus have supported my learning. Living on a campus university is convenient, but travelling via bus when living off campus can be time consuming and difficult. Module choices are varied, and there are opportunitiesto take modules from outside your course which adds to the variety of your degree. In 1st year, module choices were limited but this gets better with each year. Facilities on campus are good, and the support of the rootes grid and university house mean the library is not overcrowded. The refurbished gym on campus is convenient. Good choice of food outlets on campus but all owned by Warwick Retail so prices could be better."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Philosophy with Classical Civilisation BA (Hons)," The university is generally fine, but a couple of issues could be the washing machines, which are quite unreliable. Costcutter is abit expensive and the post room is quite far away."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Film and Literature BA (Hons)," Really good course. Workload is a good balance and the teaching is generally excellent.The university should make sure seminar tutor are able to run seminars though. Rootes the best accomodation, it has the best social life."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons)," Warwick is a really good place to be, really nice people and a good course. The main downside is the lack of city life, but this is to be expected from a campus uni."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," The SU is really good, and I'm impressed with the restaurants and bars etc. However one thing that could be improved is the fact that the one pharmacy is closed at weekends."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I am quite satisfied with my choice of university. Warwick offers many possibilites to exploit. A lot of nice people, having great fun. Lecturers are alright. Accomodation on campus was very nice, although it gets boring sometimes. The cities around are quite handy, but it takes a bit to go there. The SU could be improved with better events and nicer location."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall excellent experience. Job prospects are second to none here at Warwick. Teaching is of a very high standard however some lecturers just read their lectures from notes. Facilities and accomodation are very good with only a few minor problems. The uni is quite far from the centre of coventry, but there's lots to do on campus and in the SU. Eye candy could be better but what do you expect from such a top uni!"
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," Overall Warwick is a very good uni. They encourage you to work hard, but the work is manageable. As for the social life, it really depends how you approach it. If you make an effort to branch out from your kitchen (my kitchen was fine but a lot were quiet) then you will find loads of people that love going out. The campus feel is nice, and there are 3 cities within 30 minutes drive. Facilities are pretty good, especially now they've re-done the gym. The only problem is that campus is quite expensive for food, and being a campus uni, shopping elsewhere can often be a hassle."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I like the fact that there are societies for everyone - and that there's such a broad mix. The university has fantastic facilities e.g. Warwick gym. It is also nice being able to meet a diverse range of people - with students coming from countries like India, Singapore and Madagascar. Job prospects for after you graduate are also fantastic."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons)," Overall a great university experience, largely thanks to the extra curricular activities. I enjoy my course but chose to do a 4th year because of my sports team. Would be happier if my department took more of an interest in my university experience, particularly in an academic sense."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Technology Management (MSc)," Good university experience. Good lectures, good nightlife, nice accommodation options. Seminars are rubbish in general."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Good facilities, on campus everything is near to accomodation so easy to get to things. Not much of a city life, they need to get a bus to go out to clubs from campus but the student union does still hold some good events."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Accomodation is awesome, facilities are awesome. Located very close to everything. Accomodation is cleaned regularly. No downsides!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Film and Literature BA (Hons)," Enjoyable course with great facilities, a lot of help provided. The accomodation is great and everyone is super nice. Would highly recommend."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," The course is superb and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable. Student night life is lively but not overwhelming, and the accomodation fosters a community feel."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick has a nice vibe. Big emphasis on learning and encouragement to attend lectures. Sports facilities are good, and great surrounding countryside. Generally expensive (drinks etc) but good links to tesco. However, getting the bus to the station is annoying."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, It is a nice place if you enjoy nature and get sick of living in big cities.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature and Creative Writing BA (Hons)," Having a good time, and looking forward to the next 2 years with my course and friends. Campus accomodation is really nice if not a little quiet sometimes."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat5,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global History MA, The social life suffer as we are several miles from both Leamington and Coventry. The course is very independent and stimulating and a lot of fun so academics are not a problem. Campus does have a real community feel though which helps socially.
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Great time at Warwick, dissappointed to be leaving. Have regretted not being more involved with societies but non really appeal. Got a great group of friends so am very lucky, and enjoy my course a great deal. Eye-candy is slim, and most people are anti-social."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Academically, it is clear from arrival what a sound and meticulous university this is. The modules are well-taught, the societies open and the atmosphere is studious but inviting. It is a shame that staff continuously are knocked down in their strike efforts; it deflates the ethos somewhat and that would be my only criticism. Otherwise, the student experience itself is brilliant."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Lots of societies to join. Good sports facilities. Far ahead in research. Accomodation is high quality.
rat3,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Business BSc (Hons), Education standards are really high especially the warwick business school. Nightlife is definitely limited but you can still have a good night out.
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat2,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys," Superb university, would recommend to anyone. There's a great atmosphere on campus and the lecturers are all top notch. Everyone is really friendly and the only downside is living on a all campus uni. So you miss out on all the great aspects of city life."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick is a fantastic university. The campus is amazing with a really active SU so it doesn't mater at all that we're a bit further from town. There is always fun things going on. Tesco's is nearby so that's convenient. There isalso a Costcutter at the SU, which is even more central, but is a bit too expensive to do your regular shopping there."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick is a great university in terms of its reputation and high standard of education. The course I study is fun and interesting, and there are always plenty of opportunitites to explore interests. The campus also provides a homey and secure environment to help students become accustomed to life away from home."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research), The accommodation at warwick is excellent compared to most other universities I have visited. The course structure is also really good and the careers service does an excellent job.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature and Creative Writing BA (Hons)," Course is so focused on where we could potentially end up working- loads of opportunities, warwick is really linked to the outside world. A bit out of the way in terms of places to live off-campus and nightlife but I'm not really a 'party animal' so that's not really a problem for me."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat2,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Very good uni for focussing on your degree, world class lecturers and also seminars make you actually do work. Night life on campus is non-existent, but if you make the effort to travel off campus there are clubs/bars etc in leamington spa"
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Automotive Engineering MEng (Hons)," Really enjoying my time here, the campus is great, the engineering course is great so far, and met a lot of people. Arthur Vick is a great place to stay, the rooms and kitchens are massive. The socities are great, there's always something for everyone. I personally have spent a lot of time with motorsports and big band. The nightlife in leamington and coventry is very good. The distance is not really an issue as there are alsways taxis and buses."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Course and job prosects are brilliant. Post room is too far away. Facilities for cricket are pretty poor.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," I think that overall I'm very pleased with the university. The facilities are excellent, giving plenty of opportunity to get involved with any sports or other societies. Although there is a good focus on careers, which I definitely feel is an advantage compared with other universities."
rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Warwick is fantastic is you are a student at the Business School, love losing at all sports apart from when we play varsity, have a diet based on overpriced sandwiches and Belvedere, have very low standards and your ultimate dream is to have an internship at Goldman Sachs that you can boast about loudly on Floor 2 of the library for everyone to hear. Unfortunately, I am none of these things. Fortunately, this makes me realise just how cool I am in comparison to most of the losers here."
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Overall I am very satisfied with my course; I find it challenging, but interesting and rewarding. The standard of accomodation is good for the price, despite the shortcomings of showering with many people. In terms of city life, there isn't much, but thats to be expected and can be overcome for those who want it."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PgDip, It's fun! Kitchen is dirty though (that might just be ours). Tesco is too far away!
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys, Good all-round university. Large variety of clubs and societies. Good courses and wide support available if needed. Lots to do on campus as well as in the surrounding areas.
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," University life is great especially for students. Provides a great atmosphere for studying and sports. Food is not too bad (eating out), not too pricey but could definitely have room for improvement. Perhaps creating new restaurant outlets? Lecturers are good and decent. Overall, good university."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat2,rat5,rat4,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," I love warwick, it's great! Better than expected. However the SU is terrible. But leamington and coventry nights out are great!"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Overall very good uni. Very quiet and not a huge amount to do socially. Lectures and tutorials are very informative and well organised. Accomodation is really very good too! However a city uni would have more to do.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," The SU is incredible and lectures and everything are great. Library has everything you need. All services on campus e.g barber. Sports are fantastic, so much on offer."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Great uni for both academic and social life. I would defnitely recommend to others. Lots of opportunity to get involved with sports, and the sports facilities are great."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Theatre and Performance Studies BA (Hons), Warwick is a really good campus based uni with all the facilities on campus that you could need. The transport links are really useful and make leaving 'the bubble' easy and enjoyable.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Well-structured degree; Good range of optional modules for Economics degrees. Accomodation is well-maintained, and the staff helpful. University facilities are good and expansive. Limited career opportunities however: careers department largely unhelpful, Warwick Finance Society is much better."
rat5,rat5,rat2,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Physics MMath&Phys," I have enjoyed my time at warwick university. It has provided an excellent platformfor my future career, both academically and through societies and extra-curricular activities."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Good quality teaching and good facilities. Could be more practical rather than mostly theoretical. 
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," Love university at Warwick. Don't worry about the cost or prospect of moving away. Everything is so easy and everyone is so nice, which makes it a lot easier."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Enjoying the sport and all the new people you meet. Advice is to give anything you're even remotely interested in a go.
rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Italian with Film Studies BA (Hons), Warwick is a really great place to meet people and have a valuable university experience. Keep in mind it is a campus uni and therefore can get a little claustrophobic.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,," I am really enjoying Warwick. My advice is to make the most of all the unique learning facilities such as the learning grid. Also, take advantage of facilities such as the arts centre, and have a fab time like me!"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Instrumental and Analytical Methods in Biological and Environmental Chemistry PgDip," My subject course is interesting, my opportunities to get involved with clubs and societies are plentiful, and the tutors are helpful."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, Warwick is good. Really enjoying my time here so far. Advice would be to make sure you choose your accomodation carefully.
rat2,rat2,rat3,rat3,,,rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Sociology (MA), The learning grid should be 24 hours. There should be shuttle bus to Cannon Park. Need more SU events!
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biomedical Science BSc (Hons), Pretty good. Be open minded and just have fun!
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat, Make sure you pick a course that you think you will enjoy and do some research before deciding on which uni you choose.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PgDip, Good campus. It's green with lots of facilities. Warwick business school is also ranked very well.
rat4,rat5,rat2,rat5,,,rat1,rat3,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc, It's a great experience although I don't enjoy my course massively. Great university and accomodation though.
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PgDip," The SU is awesome but the facilities need to be improved a little bit. Also, costcutter is way too expensive."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, It's been quite enjoyable. One important piece of advice would be to be open and confident. 
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," Everything is good on paper; facilities, library and buildings are all good. The main problem is the other people at Warwick. They don't have much of a sense of humour. Definitely recommend if you want to do maths but didn’t get into Cambridge."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," The university's outside accomodation is OK. However, the bus service is not good so should be improved. "
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," Uni has been great so far, the lectures have been brilliant, campus is great and the people are all lovely. A piece of advice would be to manage your time well, and try to get involved with as much as possible whilst at uni with societies events because time is limited!"
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat2,,,rat4,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Accounting and Finance MSc," The SU is far too commercialised. It's also too expensive to join clubs, sports and societies. The Uni should subsidise extra-curricular activities to allow more people to be involved."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)"," Start working from the very start, and join as many societies as you can during first year!"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat," Warwick's a nice campus uni to hang out in and around. You always run into people you know which is good. My course is fine, and im enjoying being part of sports/societies. The facilities at Warwick are really good, especially sports facilities. Costcutter could be a little bit cheaper, but that's the only thing really. Reccommend."
rat3,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," It's pretty good for most things, however it can be boring on the weekends. Advice would be to make the most of extra curricular stuff."
rat2,rat4,rat1,rat3,,,rat2,rat3,rat2,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Discrete Mathematics BSc (Hons)," The uni is awful, full of stuck-up snobs. Don't take discrete maths, no departments care about you. Not good for joint degrees. You may get a good job at the end of it, but I'm having the worst 3 years of my life. Nightlife is bad, everyone focusses on getting drunk."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Best economics course in the UK. Heronbank is a nice accomodation, although quiet at times. Kasbah is good in Coventry, and Gatecrasher is good in Birmingham, but leamington clubs get boring. University facilities are excellent, such as sport facilities and the learning grid. There is a huge selection of societies and clubs. There are good places to eat, and the dirty duck is a nice pub."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Stay in Rootes, it is easily the most fun. Use the learning grid sometimes. Join socieites and get to know as many people as possible. Warwick is fun!"
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, Great campus and a very good economics department. Having a great time.
rat2,rat4,rat1,rat2,,,rat1,rat1,rat2,rat1,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Cultural Policy and Management MA," To be honest, there are many crimes in the post grad hub. (PC stolen, wallet stolen, keys stolen…). There was also a car accident in which a student was killed. Coventry is horrible, but being within a nice calm countryside is the best environment for studying."
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Cultural Policy and Management MA," If you are looking for a place only to study, then this is the place. Campus life is quiet and don’t expect to have a social life unless you are here for drinks."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Warwick's been great so far. Make sure you join a sports club or a society to really make the most of the social life.
rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," The SU is great, until you become an exec member of a sport or society and realise they are super unhelpful. No-one can say that Warwick doesn't have a society for everyone (LARP?). Choose your course carefully. It's better to do something you actually enjoy rather than something you believe will lead you straight into a job, the chances are it probably wont. Get involved as much as you can... most people see their degree as secondary anyway. Finally, never try and do all the reading... you never, ever, EVER will."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Philosophy, Politics and Economics BA/BSc (Hons)"," Go out lots, don't forget that first year doesn't count! I couldn't have asked for a better first six months. "
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biomedical Science BSc (Hons)," The university is good but my course is not exctly what I expected. The lectures are ok, but extra activities could be done to ensure adequate learning."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil," Overall good, but campus is too big and so better on-campus travelling provisions are required."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat1,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," I love Warwick, but the union nightlife desperately needs improving. More variation and consistent events."
rat5,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Business with Accounting and Finance (MSc)," Yes, enjoying the university experience. A great experience and a different environment. Those who are looking forward to coming here will have a great time but be prepared for the cold!"
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History and Politics BA (Hons), Great experience. Great opportunity to meet new people and have fun. Enjoy first year but make sure to work hard too. 
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research), Great flatmates! Course is interesting and nightlife is pretty decent.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat3,rat3,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,German and Business Studies BA (Hons), The reputation of Warwick resonates well with employers and will help you get a job. The accomodation is affordable and not bad for what you get (good size). However there is no city life (campus uni).
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Mathematics and Statistics MMathStat, Nothing like I've experienced before! Very difficult course but nothing that I didn't expect. Overall very happy!
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," Warwick has been amazing. It has provided great opportunities for networking, and career opportunities. My course has been fantastic and I would highly recommend the university overall."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat4,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," The course is interesting but can be irrelevant and longer than needed. Living in leamington is better than living on campus, and the clubs in leamington are good. However the SU doesn't have much to do."
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature PgDip," Warwick campus has great facilities and a wide range of events and activities. Staff are usually helpful and well informed, and lectures are well organised."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Instrumental and Analytical Methods in Biological and Environmental Chemistry PgDip," The university is pretty good. However, need more clubs in Leamington to improve the nightlife."
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat4,,,rat3,rat5,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons)," 1. tutors are useful 2. Rootes is cheap and cleaner comes often 3. Leamington is lovely 4. Great gym 5. Lots of societies to choose from 6. in terms of eye candy, the guys are kind of short."
rat4,rat5,rat2,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons), Make the most out of socialising in first year! Make sure not to get too bogged down with work.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature PgDip, 1. It's awesome! Make sure you take advantage of all the clubs and societies! 2. don't waste your money on booze 3. go to the arts centre as much as possible. Everything I've been to see has been amazing and cheap for students. 4. get the work/play balance right. 5 visit your tutors. annoy them and get your money's worth!
rat5,rat4,rat5,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Join loads of societies when you arrive. It's when you'll have the most time to make the most of these.
rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Secondary Education (Science: Physics) PGCE," My course is un-interesting and not immersing with not enough time spent in smaller groups. The uni has a good night-life with Leamington and Coventry close by. There is a good chance of getting a job, even if I have learned nothing."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons)," Uni life is great, it gives you an opportunity to be independent but also to have loads of fun! Piece of advice. Join loads of societies, have fun and remember that first year doesn't count towards your final degree!"
rat3,rat3,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat2,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Cultural Policy and Management MA," I feel that the bus services could be improved. They could be more accessible, and also cheaper. Other than that the University is ok."
rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law and Business Studies BA (Hons)," The law part is quite difficult to understand, should have more support from the university to let students receive better knowledge. Business is relatively easier, so far so good. "
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat2,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,English Literature PgDip, Warwick is nice. The campus is good and has a good SU; all facilities are close by. 
rat3,rat5,rat3,rat5,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil," Warwick is alright. Good courses and lectures, and lots of extra curricular activities to get involved in."
rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Manufacturing Systems Engineering MSc," The uni is really good, excellent staff. Lectures could be better scheduled (no gaps!)"
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat3,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Advice would be to record lectures. Method of ensuring cleanliness of kitchen could be changed. Love societies.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons), The campus and the people here are both lovely. The facilities are great although I do think costcutter should be cheaper.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Theatre and Performance Studies BA (Hons)," I'm having a really fantastic time with plenty of wonderful new people, experiences and knowledge. I recommend being as open and social as you're comfortable with, seizing every opportunity available and having a great time. "
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," Good for engineering because of investments. However, I wouldn't want to be a humanities student."
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Politics and East Asia (MA)," Warwick is really good for educational value but not too good for eye candy. To be honest, we live in a bit of a bubble where ugly people are seen as 'hot'. A Warwick 8 is a real life 4. Depressing."
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons)," Warwick has a huge variety of societies that you can get involved in, so it’s a nice place to develop your skills."
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," I've enjoyed pretty much me entire time at Warwick. Make sure to get involved with as many sports and societies as you can. The facilities are good, including the new gym. Also, accomodation is pretty good aswell but make sure you choose it wisely. Some are definitely quieter than others. If you want a more fun halls, go with rootes."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,History of Art (MA by Research)," I'm really enjoying my uni experience. Everybody is friendly, there is plenty to do and lots of places to go out. Overall, it is a really nice place to study."
rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,, Make sure you choose the right course! Make an effort to mix and socialise during freshers or you'll regret it.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biochemistry BSc (Hons), Enjoying the course and have met some great people. Would advise students to join as many clubs as possible and meet loads of people.
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Computer Science MEng (Hons), I'd recommend rootes halls. They're the most fun. Top Uni though. Although the SU needs better performers.
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Biological Sciences PhD," Enjoying the university. Few problems, but am definitely still glad I came here. "
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat4,rat4,rat2,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," The course is great as you get a lot of freedom to take modules of your choice. In your 2nd and 3rd year social life revolves around sports clubs and societies, so get involved. The nights out are decent to start with but going to the same few places eventually gets abit boring. Overall though, Warwick is a great uni, and its graduates are looked upon very highly be employers."
rat5,rat5,rat4,rat5,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA, Get involved in the huge range of clubs and socities. The whole experience is amazing with so many things to do on and off campus.
rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat2,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Politics and East Asia (MA)," Very different to school, but I feel the courses are poor value for money. Great facilities though, and an excellent seminar system that works well with independent learning."
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Secondary Education (Science: Physics) PGCE, Loving Warwick so far. In my final year and it's been great. Course is good and have loved playing sports. My advice would be to make the most of every opportunity you get.
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat1,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Politics and East Asia (MA), Good campus university but be prepared for no city life. Career prospects appear to be good and lecturers are always focussed. 
rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Instrumental and Analytical Methods in Biological and Environmental Chemistry PgDip, Advice: get involved with as much as possible and make sure you have a good work and social life balance!
rat4,rat4,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,"Economics, Politics and International Studies BA (Hons)", Consider other factors other than university ranking when choosing university.

rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat2,rat1,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Global Media and Communication (MA)," Good. However, don't come for the student life if you are a Masters student."
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat3,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Creative and Media Enterprises (MA), We definitely need more accomodation for students! More choice and more campus rooms in general.
rat5,rat5,rat5,rat5,,,rat5,rat3,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Secondary Education (Science: Physics) PGCE," As far as accommodation in first year goes, pick rootes if you want the opportunity for lots of nights out. Other accommodations don’t embrace it in the same way."
rat5,rat4,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat1,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Law MPhil, Amazeballs! Unity in diversity. Don't cause a ruckus at Heronbank.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat3,rat5,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Economics MPhil, I really enjoy the social aspect of Warwick and have made good friends in my accomodation and course. Loads of work though and accomodation could be refurbished.
rat4,rat5,rat5,rat4,,,rat4,rat5,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Evidence-Based Musculoskeletal Care (Managing Upper Limb Pain) PGA," Most convenient of all other universities, especially the ones in London. Lower cost so you save more!"
rat4,rat3,rat5,rat4,,,rat3,rat4,rat2,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Politics and Sociology BA (Hons), Be careful when applying to Warwick. I love my course but we're in the middle of nowhere and it's most definitely a disadvantage.

rat4,rat3,rat3,rat4,,,rat4,rat4,rat4,rat4,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Psychology BSc (Hons), I am enjoying uni life. I would advise those coming to uni or college to investigate what the course actually entails before coming.

rat4,rat5,rat3,rat4,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,International Business BSc (Hons), Very good academically and job prospects. However there is a bubble lifestyle with no big clubs but that is sometimes nice because you always end up bumping into a bunch of people you know.
rat4,rat3,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat3,rat2,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Italian with Film Studies BA (Hons), The seclusion of the campus can mean that living on campus can be a little like living in a bubble. I would recommend trying to experience nearby towns and off campus life/nightlife as much as possible.
rat4,rat5,rat4,rat3,,,rat3,rat4,rat3,rat3,Student Reviewer,04 Apr 14,Engineering Business Management PGA," It's good, pretty fun in general. There are loads of opportunities to meet cool people."

Gigs were pretty poor although DJ's improved ... Good - variety of facilities Close to Coventry, which I visited once. I spent most of the time in Leam or on campus. I was a member of the football club, this was a superb experience and I'm still in touch with many of the people in the teams. Each year in May we go back to the uni for a alumni vs UG match followed by watching the FA cup final together."
