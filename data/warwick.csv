We could go to the costa on campus or curiositea. Fancied a meal? We could go to one of the on campus restaurants like bar fusion. It's nothing like the city life of London, Manchester or Birmingham but it's definitely not as bad as I was made to think it was before coming here.

I've joined the Warwick student cinema; the sci-fi roleplaying and fantasy society; warwick comuting society. The food at the student union seems a little overpriced and it's difficult to find a place to sit at 1pm. Personal tutors help settle concerns with the course. on-campus clinic can settle medical concerns. Nightline is a service that allows you to drop-in and discuss personal concerns. Job prospects. Obviously it's a competitive market when considering job prospects. A recent employer event showed me how many options there are for graduates with a physics degree.""}",,,,,,,,,

A new bathroom but far away from my room. the city is far from the campus but the nightlife is good. Good sports facilities,could be better for some sports. New astroturf pitches are needed and closer changing rooms. Good academic facilities with a large library. Would be better if the library was open 24/7. I have joined the following clubs/societies - hockey,squash,RAGS and psychology. the students' union can be expensive but there are lots of events. There is nightline as a support.

Living in lakeside is good because it's quiet and makes it easy for me to study. I like to go to the city to do things like watch plays.

The Student Union is good although there could be more events for people who dont like to drink too much! I feel like job prospects are quite good for me as Warwick has a good name in India.

Careers support has been great regarding any career information, so I feel like I'm in a good position as far as job prospects go. Overall, I'd say it was a great uni.

I've joined WFS which offers great socials and work opportunities. In the SU, the nightlife is exactly the same every week, would be good if they mixed it up every now and then. Nighlint is apparently a great support service although I've never personally used it. There are also great facilities to help better your skills and your CV. Overall, I'd give warwick a 4.

If you come to warwick, make sure you think long and hard about what kind of experience you want to have, and in turn, what accommodation you will choose.

The dept is generally well organised and the lecturers are generally good teachers who care about their students. I don't think thw facilities are great. Lots of the buildings are run down and the rooms are often too small. In general the facilities are too small/limited for the number of people at the university. Overall however, I've had a lot of fun. When you get a break from work there's loads of cool things to do both in the way of sports, societies and things like bars, restuarants and clubs. Sometimes Warwick is pricey but if you don't mind that then there really is not much limit to the activities you can get involved in! Love it!""}",,,,,,,,,
