Don't join the gym unless you know you can make time for it, same with clubs and societies as they may end up being a waste of your precious time and money. Be careful about the people you meet and become friends with as they may be hiding who they really are. Do a course that you are truly interested in and will put effort into otherwise consider doing an apprenticeship or do something else as uni will be a waste of your time and life force.
